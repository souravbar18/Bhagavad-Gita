        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>Those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna provides a 'Theoretic Analysis of Fragmented Worship.' He says, 'kāmais tais tair hṛita-jñānāḥ'—by those (tais tair) desires (kāmaiḥ) knowledge is stolen (hṛita-jñānāḥ). 'prapadyante ’nya-devatāḥ'—they surrender (prapadyante) to other demigods (anya-devatāḥ). 'taṁ taṁ niyamam āsthāya'—following (āsthāya) those various rules (taṁ taṁ niyamam). 'prakṛityā niyatāḥ svayā'—controlled (niyatāḥ) by their own (svayā) natures (prakṛityā). This analysis focuses on the 'Theoretic Divergence of the Soul.' Krishna explains that when material desire dominates, the intellect loses its ability to see the 'Absolute One' and instead looks for 'Specialized Powers.' In the 'Theoretic Framework of Material Causality,' people seek specific deities for specific boons—wealth, health, or progeny. This detailed analysis reveals that Krishna defines 'Polytheistic Tendencies' as a symptom of 'Stolen Knowledge.' The seeker becomes focused on the 'Instrument' rather than the 'Source.' This shloka provides a ' Framework for the Psychology of Attachment.' It teaches that our 'Prakṛiti' (material nature) dictates our religious inclinations when we lack the highest wisdom. Krishna is telling Arjuna that the 'Other Gods' are essentially departmental heads, but people worship them because they want 'Quick Results' rather than 'Eternal Truth.' This is the ' Goal of the Result-Oriented Seeker,' where 'The Focus' is 'Immediate'.</p>
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Hṛita-jñānāḥ' (Stolen Intelligence) is the 'Theoretic Description of Cognitive Narrowing.' In our practical lives, when we want something desperately, we lose sight of the big picture. Krishna is stating that 'Desire' acts as a 'Screen' that hides the Supreme. Krishna is defining 'The Self' as the 'One who is currently driven by impulse.' This shloka provides a 'Framework for Understanding Cultural Rituals.' It teaches that 'Niyama' (rules) are often followed not for spiritual growth, but for material 'Payoffs.' Krishna is defining 'Prakṛityā' (Nature) as the 'Internal Blueprint' that pushes a person toward certain types of worship. This verse is the ' Proof that we choose our gods based on our greed.' By using the phrase 'Any-devatāḥ' (Other deities), He acknowledges their existence but highlights the 'Limited Vision' of their worshippers. This shloka is the 'Universal Manual for the Driven Soul,' forcing us to realize that 'We often treat the Divine like a vending machine for our worldly cravings'. This is the ' Goal of the Impulsive Seeker,' where 'The Vision' is 'Fragmented'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 7.20 explores the  'Ontology of the Desire-Driven Intellect.' , the 'Jñāna' (Knowledge) of the Supreme is always present, but it is 'Suppressed' by the noise of 'Kāma' (Desire). This verse highlights the 'Theory of the Divided Devotion.' Philosophically, it addresses the 'Nature of Demigod Worship.' , 'Devatās' are functional aspects of the cosmic order. Worshiping them is like 'Asking a Minister' for a favor rather than 'Asking the King.' This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the Subjective Religion.'</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Niyatāḥ svayā' refers to 'The Philosophy of Psychological Determinism.' , without 'Spiritual Education,' humans are 'Slaves' to their 'Samskaras' (past impressions). Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Nature of Ritualism.' , rituals (*Niyama*) become 'Barriers' if they are performed solely for 'Acquisition.' This shloka is the  'End of Superficial Spirituality.' , turning to many sources for many needs is 'Spiritual Adultery.' Philosophically, it highlights the 'Relationship between the Seeker's Maturity and the Target of Worship.' , the 'Mature Soul' seeks the 'Absolute,' while the 'Immature Soul' seeks 'Appeasement.' Krishna is teaching 'Metaphysical Discernment.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches 'The Superiority of Centralized Devotion.' This verse is the ' Proof that pluralistic material worship is a distraction,' providing the logical structure to understand that 'God is often hidden by the very things we ask Him for'. It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the One'.</p>
