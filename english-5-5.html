        यत्साङ्ख्यैः प्राप्यते स्थानं तद्योगैरपि गम्यते |<br>

        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>One who knows that the position reached by means of analytical study can also be attained by devotional service, and who therefore sees analytical study and devotional service to be on the same level, sees things as they are.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna reinforces the 'Identity of the Result.' He says, 'yat saṅkhyaiḥ prapyate sthanam'—what (yat) by the followers of Sankhya (sankhyaih) is attained (prapyate) position/state (sthanam). 'tad yogair api gamyate'—that (tat) by the Yogis (yogaih) also (api) is reached (gamyate). 'ekam saṅkhyam cha yogam cha'—one (ekam) Sankhya and Yoga. 'yaḥ pashyati sa pashyati'—he who sees (yah pashyati) truly sees (sah pashyati). This analysis focuses on the 'Unity of the Destination.' Krishna is clarifying that the 'Sthanam' (state of liberation) reached through 'Sankhya' (the path of knowledge and renunciation) is the exact same 'Sthanam' reached through 'Yoga' (the path of selfless action). To the superficial observer, the monk sitting in meditation and the worker performing their duty appear to be doing different things. However, Krishna states that if their 'Internal Alignment' is correct, their spiritual outcome is identical. The 'Pandita' or the 'Seer' is the one who perceives this 'Ekam' (Oneness). This is a  blow to 'Spiritual Elitism.' It suggests that the 'High' path of philosophy is not superior to the 'Low' path of service. The phrase 'Sah Pashyati' (He truly sees) implies that anyone who sees these two as separate is suffering from a 'Vision Impairment.' True vision is the ability to see the 'Universal Essence' behind the 'Functional Form.' Krishna is guiding Arjuna to understand that 'Wisdom' and 'Work' are not rivals, but twins. </p>
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Sah Pashyati' is the ' Description of Correct Perception.' In our practical lives, we are often 'Blinded by Appearances.' Krishna is stating that 'The Truth' is 'Hidden in Plain Sight.' Krishna is defining 'The Seer' as one who 'Synthesizes' rather than 'Segregates.' This shloka provides a 'Framework for Non-Dual Methodology.' It teaches that 'The Peak' is the same regardless of 'The Trail.' Krishna is defining 'Ekam' as the 'Ultimate Singularity.' This verse is the ' Validation of All Paths.' By using the word 'Api' (also), He bridges the gap between the intellectual and the active. This shloka is the 'Universal Antidote to Sectarianism,' forcing us to realize that 'All true efforts converge'. This is the ' Goal of Holistic Understanding,' where 'The Vision' is 'Unified'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 5.5 explores the  'Concept of Functional Equivalence.' , 'Knowledge' and 'Action' are different 'Modes of Being' but the same 'State of Grace.' This verse highlights the 'Theory of the Single Sthanam.' Philosophically, it addresses the 'Nature of Pashyati' (Seeing). , 'Seeing' is not an 'Optical' act but an 'Intellectual' realization of 'Non-Difference.' This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the Convergent Reality.'</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Sankhya and Yoga' refers to the 'Dialectic of the Soul.' , one cannot be a 'Sankhyi' without the 'Yoga' of discipline, and one cannot be a 'Yogi' without the 'Sankhya' of understanding. Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Nature of the Result' (Phalam). , the 'Result' is the 'Dissolution of the Ego.' Whether you dissolve it through 'Knowledge' or 'Service,' the 'Void' left behind is the same 'Infinite.' This shloka is the  'End of Categorical Thinking.' , categories are 'Scaffolding' that must be removed once the 'Building' (Vision) is complete. Philosophically, it highlights the 'Relationship between the Observer and the Observed.' , if you see 'Two,' you are the 'Ego'; if you see 'One,' you are the 'Self.' Krishna is teaching 'Metaphysical Integration.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches 'The Unity of the Sanatana Dharma.' This verse is the ' Proof that all paths are valid,' providing the logical structure to understand that 'Truth is a shoreless ocean'. It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Divine' is 'The Single Truth'.</p>
