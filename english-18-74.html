        सञ्जय उवाच ।<br>
        इत्यहं वासुदेवस्य पार्थस्य च महात्मन: ।<br>

        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>Sanjaya said: I have thus heard the conversation of two great souls, Krishna and Arjuna. And so wonderful is that message that my hair is standing on end.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>At this point, the narrative voice shifts back to Sanjaya, who has been relaying the entire conversation to King Dhritarashtra through his divine vision. Sanjaya expresses his own overwhelming emotion, saying that he has heard this samvadam (conversation) between Vasudeva (Krishna) and the mahatmanah (great soul) Arjuna. He describes the dialogue as adbhutam (wonderful/miraculous) and roma-harshanam (causing the hair to stand on end). This verse marks the beginning of the Phala-stuti from Sanjaya's perspective. For a Hindu, it represents the experiential aspect of the Gita—how it affects those who witness it. The analysis reveals that the Gita is not just a philosophical lecture but an aesthetic and emotional experience. Sanjaya is identifying that even as a third-party observer, the power of the truth is so intense that it manifests physically as goosebumps (Roma-harshanam). This verse serves as a testimony to the Gita's impact; it proves that the message is universal and can move anyone who listens with an open heart. The term Mahatmanah used for Arjuna indicates that by the end of the Gita, Arjuna has regained his status as a great soul. Sanjaya's diagnosis proves that spiritual truth is Adbhutam—it transcends logic and touches the deepest parts of our being. This shloka provides a standard for spiritual Rasas or flavors. It encourages the individual to not just read the Gita, but to feel its grandeur. It reinforces the idea that the Divine presence is tangible and can be felt through His words. By sharing his excitement, Sanjaya is inviting Dhritarashtra (and the reader) to share in the joy of this revelation. However, while Sanjaya is thrilled, Dhritarashtra remains silent, indicating that knowledge only benefits those who are ready for it. Thus, the Gita teaches that the ultimate conversation is one that happens between the soul and God. Therefore, witnessing this dialogue is a rare privilege that brings supreme ecstasy. This verse begins the concluding section where Sanjaya reflects on his gratitude for being chosen as the narrator of this divine epic. In summary, Sanjaya's physical reaction is proof of the Gita's living power to transform and uplift the consciousness of anyone who encounters it.</p>
