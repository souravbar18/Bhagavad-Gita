        समं पश्यन्हि सर्वत्र समवस्थितमीश्वरम्।<br>

        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>One who sees the Supersoul equally present everywhere, in every living being, does not degrade himself by his mind. Thus he approaches the transcendental destination.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>In Shloka 13.29, Lord Krishna returns to the  Distinction between the  Doer and the  Observer. He states that one who pasyati (sees) that all karmani (actions) are kriyamânâni (being performed) sarvasah (in all respects) by Prakritya eva (by nature alone), and perceives the atmanam (self) as akartâram (the non-doer), is the one who sah pasyati (truly sees). This analysis focuses on the  Liberation from the Ego-Sense. Krishna is teaching that the  Soul is  Passive while the  Material Nature (Prakriti) is  Active. The detailed analysis of Prakritya eva highlights that our physical movements, thoughts, and sensory interactions are all  Mechanical Processes of the three Gunas. The body is a  Biological Machine that operates according to the laws of nature. This shloka provides a  Framework for  Detachment. Most people suffer because they  Claim doership. They say, I am doing this, and thus they  Bind themselves to the  Results (Karma). By atmanam akartâram, Krishna points to the  Transcendence of the spirit. The soul is like the sun, which provides the light for all activities on earth but does not itself  Participate in those activities. This religious interpretation emphasizes that  Wisdom is the ability to  Resign all actions to nature while remaining a  Silent Witness. This verse is the  Cure for  Pride and  Guilt. If I am not the doer, I cannot be  Proud of my success, nor can I be  Crushed by my failure. This detailed explanation clarifies that  Truth is the realization that the Knower of the Field is the  Resident, not the  Laborer. Krishna is providing the logical structure for  Inner Freedom amidst  Outer Action. This  Vision allows the seeker to perform their duty with  Perfection because they are no longer  Hampered by the  Anxiety of the ego-sense.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance:</span>
            <p>The philosophical depth of Shloka 13.29 lies in the Ontology of Non-Agency. Philosophically, it addresses the Problem of Determinism and Free Will. If nature does everything, am I just a puppet? The deep philosophical significance is that Freedom lies in the  Choice of Identification. We cannot  Stop the laws of nature (Prakriti), but we can  Stop identifying with them. Philosophically, this verse asserts that the Self is  Actionless (Nishkriya). This is a radical  Shift from  Humanism to  Spiritualism. Philosophically, the phrase sarvasah implies that there is no  Exception—even our highest  Intellectual Acts are products of the refined modes of nature. This shloka also addresses the  Peace of the Witness. By  Distancing oneself from the action, one attains  Tranquility. The religious significance is that the Supreme Lord has  Designed the universe as a  Self-Running System. The  conclusion is that  Realization is the  Discovery of our  Eternal Stillness. Krishna is highlighting that the Universal Spirit is the  Ocean, while actions are just  Waves on the surface. By knowing the depth of the ocean, one is not  Disturbed by the height of the waves. This  Vision is the  Key to Naiskarmya (freedom from karma). It teaches that the ultimate  Action is the  Insight into our own  Non-Action. This realization is what  Dissolves the  Illusion of the  Small Self and  Merges the seeker's awareness with the  Infinite Reality.</p>
