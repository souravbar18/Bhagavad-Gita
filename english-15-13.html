        गामाविश्य च भूतानि धारयाम्ह्योजसा।<br>

        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>I enter into each planet, and by My energy they stay in orbit. I become the moon and thereby supply the juice of life to all vegetables.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>In this thirteenth verse, Shri Krishna continues His description of divine immanence by explaining how He sustains the physical earth and all plant life. He states: Entering the earth, I support all beings by My energy (<i>Ojasā</i>), and becoming the moon, the source of nectar (<i>Somaḥ rasātmakaḥ</i>), I nourish all plants and herbs. This analysis reveals the Divine as the ultimate Biological Sustainer. The word <i>Gām</i> refers to the earth, and <i>Āviśya</i> means to enter or permeate. Krishna is declaring that the very structural integrity of the planet—the forces like gravity and cohesion that allow the earth to hold living beings—is a manifestation of His divine Ojas. Furthermore, He identifies Himself with the Rasātmakaḥ Soma, the moon that provides the vital juices or sap to the vegetation. In Vedic science, the moon was seen as the deity presiding over the nourishing properties of plants. This means that the vitamins, minerals, and healing essences in our food are not just chemical compounds, but Divine Nourishment provided by the Lord Himself.</p>

        <p>From a religious perspective, this verse teaches the concept of Sacred Sustenance. It reminds the devotee that they are literally being held in the hands of God at every moment. When we walk on the ground, we are being supported by His Ojas. When we eat a fruit or a medicinal herb, we are consuming the Rasa (juice/essence) that He has personally infused into the plant. This detailed analysis fosters a deep sense of Ecosystemic Spirituality. It encourages the seeker to view nature with profound gratitude and reverence. We are not independent entities struggling for survival; we are guests at a divine banquet where the Host (Krishna) provides both the ground we stand on and the food we eat. This understanding is intended to remove Arjuna's fear and anxiety. If the Lord is personally entering the earth to support all beings, then Arjuna can trust that he is being protected and sustained in his righteous path. This verse encourages a lifestyle of <span class="highlight">Prasada-buddhi</span>—the attitude that everything we receive from nature is a sacred gift from the Divine. It connects the Microcosm of our personal hunger with the Macrocosm of divine nourishment, establishing a holistic world-view where the Divine is the gardener and the garden itself.</p>

        <h2>Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis</h2>
        <p>The philosophical weight of Shloka 13 lies in the Theory of Structural and Vital Maintenance. , it posits that matter is inert and requires a conscious Will to remain organized. This addresses the Stability Problem of the universe. In this religious theory, the Divine is the <span class="highlight">Dharaka</span> (Sustainer). , Ojas is the spiritual energy that translates into physical forces like gravity and electromagnetic cohesion. Philosophically, this suggests that the physical world is a Consistently Maintained Thought of the Supreme Person. Without the Āviśya (entering) of the Divine, the material world would disintegrate into chaos. The  concept of Soma as the essence of plants addresses the Vitality Problem—how life-force is transferred from the environment to the living body.</p>

        <p>The significance of the moon as Rasātmakaḥ (composed of rasa) is a profound  insight into the nature of Nourishment. , <span class="highlight">Rasa</span> is the subtle essence that provides satisfaction and health. This leads to the theory of the Cycle of Energy, where the Divine light of the sun is transformed into the Divine sap of the moon and then into the Divine strength of the living being. , this verse provides a Sacred Physics and Sacred Biology where the Laws of Nature are seen as Functional Roles of the Divine. Philosophically, it destroys the concept of Dead Matter. If the earth is permeated by the Lord's energy, then every atom is Alive with His presence. The  goal is to realize the Total Dependency of the Jiva on the Purushottama. By understanding this, the seeker moves from a state of Egoistic Autonomy to Devotional Surrender. This  framework leads to a life of <span class="highlight">Ahinsa</span> (non-violence) and environmental stewardship, as the individual realizes that every part of nature is a Divine Support System maintained by the Supreme Lord personally. It represents the ultimate  Integration of theology and ecology.</p>
