        न च मत्स्थानि भूतानि पश्य मे योगमैश्वरम् |<br>
        भूतभृन्न च भूतस्थो ममात्मा भूतभावन: || ९.५ ||

    <div class="religious-content">
        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>And yet everything that is created does not rest in Me. Behold My mystic opulence! Although I am the maintainer of all living entities and although I am everywhere, I am not a part of this cosmic manifestation, for My Self is the very source of creation.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna identifies the 'Theoretic Mystery of Divine Opulence.' He says, 'na cha mat-sthāni bhūtāni'—and yet (na cha) beings (bhūtāni) do not (na) rest in Me (mat-sthāni). 'paśhya me yogam aiśhvaram'—behold (paśhya) My (me) mystic (yogam) opulence (aiśhvaram). 'bhūta-bhṛin na cha bhūta-stho'—maintainer (bhṛit) of beings (bhūta) but not (na cha) in beings (bhūta-sthaḥ). 'mamātmā bhūta-bhāvanaḥ'—My (mama) self (ātmā) is the source (bhāvanaḥ) of beings (bhūta). This analysis focuses on the 'Theoretic Resolution of the Paradox.' In the previous verse, He said everything is in Him; now He says they are not. In the 'Theoretic Framework of Absolute Purity,' this means that material contact does not 'Touch' the Spirit. This detailed analysis reveals that Krishna defines 'Yogam Aiśhvaram' as His ability to be the 'Cause' without being the 'Causality.' This shloka provides a ' Framework for Divine Detachment.' It teaches that while God maintains everything, He is 'Untainted' by the qualities (gunas) of the creation. Krishna is telling Arjuna that 'I am the stage, but I am not the play; I am the author, but I am not the ink.' This is the ' Goal of the Awakened Seeker,' where 'The Opulence' is 'Marvelled'.</p>
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Yoga-Aiśhvaram' (Mystic Opulence) is the 'Theoretic Description of Spiritual Sovereignty.' In our practical lives, if we 'Maintain' a family, we are 'Stressed' by it. Krishna is stating that His 'Maintenance' of the universe is 'Stress-free' and 'Non-entangling.' Krishna is defining 'The Self' as the 'One who is both the container and the contained, yet neither.' This shloka provides a 'Framework for the Ultimate Mystery.' It teaches that God’s relationship with the world is 'Acintya' (Inconceivable). Krishna is defining 'Bhūta-bhāvanaḥ' as the 'Creator-Source.' This verse is the ' Proof that the Divine is not a part of the material energy, even though the energy comes from Him.' By using the word 'Paśhya' (Behold), He invites Arjuna to see with the 'Eye of Wisdom.' This shloka is the 'Universal Manual for the Mystic Soul,' forcing us to realize that 'God is simultaneously intimately involved and infinitely distant'. This is the ' Goal of the Enlightened Seeker,' where 'The Duality' is 'Reconciled'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 9.5 explores the  'Ontology of the Source.' , 'Creation' is an 'Appearance' in the Absolute. This verse highlights the 'Theory of Varta-vada' (The theory of manifestation without transformation). Philosophically, it addresses the 'Nature of Ownership.' , God owns the universe, but He is not 'Defined' by His possessions. This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the Inconceivable Relationship.'</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Bhūta-bhṛit' refers to 'The Philosophy of the Sustenance.' , everything exists because God 'Wills' it. Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Nature of the Atma' (*Mamātmā*). , the 'Self' of the Lord is identical to the 'Source' of the world. This shloka is the  'End of Materialism.' , matter has no 'Independent Reality.' Philosophically, it highlights the 'Relationship between the Creator and the Created.' , the creation is 'Dependent' on the Creator, but the Creator is 'Sovereign.' Krishna is teaching 'Metaphysical Majesty.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches 'The Glory of the Supreme Person.' This verse is the ' Proof that the Divine is the ultimate mystery,' providing the logical structure to understand that 'God is found in the paśhya (beholding) of His opulence'. It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the Mystic Power'.</p>
