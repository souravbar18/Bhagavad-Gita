            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna provides a profound psychological explanation for why many people struggle to find spiritual clarity. He says, 'bhogaisvarya-prasaktanam'—those who are deeply attached to 'Bhoga' (enjoyment) and 'Aishvarya' (power/opulence). He then uses the powerful phrase 'tayapahrita-chetasam'—those whose 'Chetas' (consciousness or heart) has been stolen or carried away by those very desires. For such individuals, 'vyavasayatmika buddhih'—the resolute, one-pointed intelligence—'samadhau na vidhiyate'—does not become established in 'Samadhi' (the state of being fixed on the Divine). This analysis focuses on the 'Theft of Consciousness.' Desire is described as a thief that steals our cognitive ability to focus on Truth. When the mind is obsessed with what it can consume or control, it loses its 'Gravity.' It becomes scattered, making it impossible to achieve the deep concentration required for 'Yoga.' Krishna is explaining to Arjuna why he feels so confused: his attachment to the fruits of the battle (or the avoidance of its pain) is preventing his 'Buddhi' (intellect) from reaching a stable state.</p>
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Samadhau' (in Samadhi) is essential here. 'Samadhi' is often misunderstood as merely a trance state. In the context of the Gita, it refers to 'Samyak-Adhi'—an intellect that is perfectly balanced and fixed on the 'Self.' In our practical lives, we see this in the distraction culture. When we are 'Prasaktanam' (attached) to constant stimulation, our ability to make 'Resolute Decisions' disappears. We become 'Avyavasayi' (wavering). Krishna is teaching that 'Spiritual Determination' is not just a matter of willpower; it is a matter of 'Internal Environment.' If the environment is polluted by greed for 'Bhoga,' the 'Seed of Yoga' cannot sprout. This shloka provides a 'Scientific Diagnosis of Spiritual Failure.' It teaches that we cannot think our way to Truth if our emotions are anchored in material acquisition. Krishna is telling Arjuna that his concern for the social and personal consequences of the war is a form of 'Bhoga-Aishvarya' attachment (wanting a peaceful life or a good reputation). This verse serves as a 'Call to Decisive Renunciation.' It's not about leaving the world, but about taking back your 'Chetas' from the thieves of desire. This is the ' Foundation of Concentration,' proving that 'Samadhi' is the natural result of a mind that has stopped bargaining with reality. By highlighting the 'Apahrita-chetasam,' Krishna is urging Arjuna to reclaim his stolen consciousness so that he can finally see the 'Dharmic Path' with absolute clarity.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 2.44 explores the  'Incompatibility of Desire and Wisdom.' , 'Kama' (desire) and 'Jnana' (knowledge) are like 'Light' and 'Darkness.' This verse highlights the 'Theory of Consciousness Entrapment.' Philosophically, it addresses the 'Mechanism of Bewilderment.' , 'Prakriti' (nature) uses 'Bhoga' to bind the 'Purusha' (soul). When the 'Buddhi' is 'Apahrita' (stolen), the individual loses the 'Discriminating Power' (*Viveka-shakti*) to differentiate between the 'Eternal' and the 'Transient.'</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Samadhi' refers to the 'Equilibrium of the Intellect.' , 'Samadhi' is the 'Steady State' of the soul where it is no longer perturbed by the 'Vrittis' (ripples of thought). Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Ontology of Attachment.' , 'Attachment' creates a 'False Center' for the ego. As long as the 'Center' is 'External' (in enjoyment or power), the 'Buddhi' can never be 'Internalized.' This shloka is the  'Deconstruction of the Distracted Mind.' Philosophically, it highlights the 'Relationship between Values and Vision.' , what we value determines what we see. If we value 'Bhoga,' we are blind to 'Dharma.' Krishna is teaching 'Epistemological Purification.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches 'Purity of Intent.' This verse is the ' Warning against the 'Divided Heart,' providing the logical structure to understand that 'Total Commitment' is the only currency accepted in the realm of the 'Spirit.' It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'Determination' is a fruit of 'Vairagya' (dispassion). Without letting go of the 'Horizontal Cravings,' one can never climb the 'Vertical Path' of 'Self-Realization'.</p>
