        अवाच्यवादांश्च बहून्वदिष्यन्ति तवाहिताः ।<br>

        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>Your enemies will describe you in many unkind words and scorn your ability. What could be more painful for you?</p>
        
        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna continues his psychological deconstruction of Arjuna’s hesitation by focusing on the 'Pain of Scorn.' He says, 'avachya-vadansh-cha bahun-vadishyanti tavahitah'—your enemies will speak many 'avachya' (unspeakable or abusive) words about you. He adds, 'nindantastava samarthyam'—they will mock and criticize your 'Samarthyam' (ability or prowess). Finally, he asks the stinging question: 'tato duhkhataram nu kim'—what could be more painful than that? This analysis focuses on the 'Social Humiliation' that follows the abandonment of duty. For a man who has spent his life building a reputation for peerless skill and bravery, to be mocked by his enemies as a eunuch or a coward is an unbearable psychological trauma. Krishna is using 'Pragmatic Reality' to counter Arjuna’s 'Idealistic Delusion.' He is showing that the peace Arjuna hopes to find by not fighting will be destroyed by the constant verbal abuse and ridicule of those he leaves undefeated.</p>
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Avachya-vada' (unspeakable words) is essential for understanding 'Kshatriya' psychology. In our practical lives, we often face 'Bullying' or 'Character Assassination' when we fail to stand up for ourselves. Krishna is teaching that 'Silence' in the face of 'Adharma' is not always 'Patience'; it can be a source of 'Duhkhataram' (greater suffering). If Arjuna quits, he gives his enemies the ultimate weapon: the 'Truth of his Withdrawal,' which they will twist into the 'Lie of his Cowardice.' This shloka addresses the 'Nature of Pain.' The pain of an arrow is physical and temporary, but the pain of 'Ninda' (scorn) from an enemy is mental and corrosive. Krishna is telling Arjuna: You are trying to avoid the 'Duhkha' (sorrow) of killing, but you are walking straight into a 'Duhkhataram' (worse sorrow)—the loss of your self-respect and the mockery of your peers. This verse provides a 'Lesson in Mental Strength.' It teaches that we must have the 'Samarthyam' (capacity) to defend our 'Honour' as much as our 'Lives.' By pointing out the 'Avachya-vada,' Krishna is provoking Arjuna's 'Dharma-Agni' (fire of righteousness). He is reminding Arjuna that as a warrior, he is 'Samartha' (capable), and to let that capacity be mocked is a sin against his own soul. This shloka is the ' Exposure of the Price of Retreat,' forcing us to realize that 'Pseudo-Spirituality' always carries a heavy social and psychological cost that is far more painful than the struggle of 'Dharma'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 2.36 explores the  'Suffering of the Social Self.' , while the 'Atman' is 'A-duhkha' (without sorrow), the 'Ahankara' (ego) and the 'Manas' (mind) are highly susceptible to 'Ninda' (criticism). Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Duality of Pleasure and Pain.' Krishna is  using a 'Lesser Evil' argument: the 'Pain' of battle is lesser than the 'Pain' of 'Akirti' (infamy). , this verse highlights the 'Theory of Psychological Deterrence.' If a leader is mocked, his 'Dharma' becomes ineffective.</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Samarthyam' (ability) refers to the 'Sacredness of Talent.' , a talent given by 'Prakriti' (nature) must be used for 'Dharma.' To allow it to be scorned is  a rejection of the 'Divine Gift.' Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Logic of Provocation.' Krishna is not inciting anger, but 'Viveka' (discernment) regarding the consequences of inaction. , 'Avachya-vada' represents the 'Voice of Adharma' triumphant. Philosophically, it teaches the 'Doctrine of Proper Presentation.' , a 'Dharmic' person must maintain the 'Gravitas' of their role. This shloka is the  'End of Sentimentality.' It highlights the 'Doctrine of Necessary Force.' , Krishna is telling Arjuna that his 'Inaction' is a 'Gift to the Wicked.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches 'Spiritual Dignity.' This verse is the ' Warning against the degradation of the Soul’s Status,' providing the logical structure to understand that 'Humiliation' born of 'Duty-Failure' is a 'Karmic Debt' that is harder to pay than 'Death.' It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'Strength' is a 'Dharmic' necessity in a world where 'Adharma' uses 'Scorn' as a weapon.</p>
