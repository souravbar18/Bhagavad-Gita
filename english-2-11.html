        <p>The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: While speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief. Those who are wise lament neither for the living nor for the dead.</p>
        
        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>This verse marks the actual beginning of the Bhagavad Gita's teaching. Krishna starts with a direct, uncompromising statement that cuts through Arjuna's delusion. He tells Arjuna, 'ashochyan-anvashochas-tvam'—you are grieving for those who are not worthy of grief. This is a shocking statement to a man who is about to kill his grandfather. Krishna then points out the irony: 'prajna-vadan-cha bhashase'—you are speaking words of great wisdom. Arjuna had spent the first chapter and the start of the second talking about 'Dharma,' 'Sin,' and 'Social Welfare.' Krishna exposes this as 'Pseudo-Wisdom.' Arjuna is using high-sounding philosophy to justify an emotional breakdown. Finally, Krishna defines the 'Panditah' (the wise): they 'na-anushochanti' (do not lament) for either 'gatasun' (the dead/those whose breath is gone) or 'agatasun' (the living). This is the 'Criterion of Wisdom'—the ability to remain steady in the face of the cycle of life and death.</p>
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Prajna-vadan' (learned words) is vital for every seeker. We often use our intellect to rationalize our weaknesses. Arjuna was not being a philosopher; he was being a coward who knew philosophy. Krishna’s first lesson is to separate 'Sentiment' from 'Truth.' He is introducing the 'Perspective of the Soul.' In our practical lives, we suffer because we attach 'Value' to things that are 'Ashochyan' (unworthy of grief), meaning they are temporary and changing. Krishna is saying that Arjuna’s focus is on the 'Body' (the dead or living), while the focus should be on the 'Soul' (the eternal). By saying 'Panditah' do not grieve, He is challenging Arjuna to raise his standard of thinking. A 'Pandita' is one whose 'Panda' (spiritual intellect) is awake. Arjuna's 'Panda' is asleep, and his 'Kama/Bhaya' (desire/fear) are awake. This verse is the first blow to the 'Deha-Atma-Buddhi' (the idea that I am the body). Krishna is establishing that the fundamental cause of suffering is 'Wrong Identification.' We grieve because we think something that is 'Dead' (matter) is the 'Self,' and that the 'Self' can die. This shloka is the cornerstone of the Gita's philosophy—the declaration of the 'Eternity of the Spirit' and the 'Transience of the Form'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 2.11 explores the  foundation of 'Atma-Jnana' (Self-knowledge). , the 'Atman' is 'A-shochya' (incapable of being an object of grief) because it is 'A-vinashi' (indestructible). Philosophically, this verse represents the 'Paradox of Learning.' One can know all the 'Shastras' (like Arjuna) and still be 'Sammudha' (deluded) if one has not realized the 'Atman.' , this is the 'Distinction between Information and Transformation.' Arjuna has information ('Prajna-vada'), but no transformation. In 'Advaita' philosophy, 'Shoka' (grief) is a 'Vritti' (mental wave) that arises only from 'Avidya' (ignorance). When the truth is known, 'Shoka' becomes  impossible.</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Gatasun-Agatasun' (Dead and Living) highlights the 'Illusion of Time.' , birth and death are merely 'Avasthas' (states) of the body, not the Soul. Philosophically, the 'Wise' (Panditah) see the 'Eternal Presence' beneath the 'Changing Presence.' , this verse introduces the 'Philosophy of Non-Duality'—where the 'Drishya' (the seen/the world) is always changing and thus not worth grieving for, while the 'Drika' (the seer/the soul) never changes. Krishna is  redefining 'Panditya' (scholarship). A scholar is not one who knows books, but one who is not shaken by the loss of breath ('Asu'). This verse highlights the 'Theory of Objectivity.' Grief is the ultimate 'Subjective Distortion.' To see things as they are, one must be 'A-shochanti.' From a religious perspective, this shloka is the 'Mahavakya' (great statement) of the Gita's first phase. It teaches that 'Dharma' cannot be understood as long as one is blinded by personal grief. , Krishna is pulling the rug out from under Arjuna’s feet; he is telling him that his entire moral dilemma is based on a 'False Premise'—the premise that life ends at death. This shloka is the ' Ignition' of the fire of knowledge that will eventually consume Arjuna’s doubts and 'Karma'.</p>
