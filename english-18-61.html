        <p>The Supreme Lord dwells in the hearts of all living beings, O Arjuna. According to their karma, He directs the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine made of material energy.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>In this extraordinarily deep verse, Lord Krishna reveals the location of the Divine and the mechanics of material existence. He declares, Ishvarah sarva-bhutanam hrid-deshe Arjuna tishthati—the Supreme Lord resides in the heart region of every living entity. This is a foundational concept in Hinduism: God is not a distant judge in the sky but the Antaryami or the Inner Witness within us. Krishna then uses a vivid metaphor: bhramayan sarva-bhutani yantra-arudhani mayaya. He describes living beings as being mounted on a Yantra (machine) made of Maya (material energy), and the Lord, by His power, causes them to travel or wander. This verse provides a profound synthesis of free will and divine providence. The analysis reveals that our physical bodies and psychological personalities are the machines we are currently occupying. These machines operate according to the laws of nature and our past Karma. Krishna is identifying that while we think we are independent doers, we are actually being moved by the complex gears of material energy. This verse serves as an antidote to human arrogance; it proves that our autonomy is limited by the vehicle we possess. However, the presence of the Lord in the heart suggests that we are never alone. He is the witness of every thought and action, providing the energy for the machine to function. The term Maya here refers to the illusory power that makes the soul identify with the machine rather than the driver or the witness. Krishna's diagnosis proves that our wandering (Bhramayan) through various lives and experiences is directed by the Divine based on our own past choices. This shloka provides a standard for spiritual humility. It encourages the individual to realize that their strength, intelligence, and life are gifts from the resident Ishvara. It reinforces the idea that the heart is the most sacred space, the real temple where the Divine can be met. By understanding that we are seated on a machine, we can begin to detach our true self (Atman) from the mechanical movements of the mind and body. This realization is the first step toward liberation. Thus, the Gita teaches that the Lord is the ultimate controller, yet He sits silently within us, waiting for us to turn our attention toward Him. Therefore, recognizing the Divine presence within is the key to stopping the aimless wandering of the soul.</p>
