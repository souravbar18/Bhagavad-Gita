        <p>For the soul there is neither birth nor death at any time. He has not come into being, does not come into being, and will not come into being. He is unborn, eternal, ever-existing and primeval. He is not slain when the body is slain.</p>
        
        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>This verse is one of the most sublime and poetic descriptions of the 'Atman' in the entire world literature. Krishna uses a series of powerful negations and affirmations to define the 'Deathless Self.' He says, 'na jayate mriyate va kadachit'—it is never born, nor does it ever die. He explains that it is not something that 'bhutva' (having been) will 'bhavita' (cease to be) or 'na bhuyah' (will happen again). The Soul is 'Ajah' (unborn), 'Nityah' (eternal), 'Shashvatah' (ever-existing), and 'Puranah' (primeval/ancient). The final punchline is 'na hanyate hanyamane sharire'—it is not killed when the body is killed. This shloka is the 'Mahamantra' of immortality. It provides a complete 'Ontological Map' of the Spirit. While the body is subject to the 'Shad-Vikara' (six changes: birth, existence, growth, modification, decay, and death), the Soul is completely 'A-vikari' (changeless).</p>
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Puranah' (Ancient yet New) is beautiful. It suggests that the soul never ages. It is as fresh today as it was billions of years ago. In our practical lives, we are obsessed with newness and youth. Krishna is telling Arjuna that he has an 'Eternal Youth' within him that never fades. This verse is the ultimate 'Fear-Killer.' If 'I' am never born and never die, then 'Birth' and 'Death' are just 'Events' I witness, like watching a movie. My 'Existence' is independent of the 'Timeline' of the body. Krishna uses the word 'Kadachit' (at any time) to emphasize that this is a 'Universal Truth'—it was true in the Satya Yuga, and it is true today. This shloka provides a 'Tranquil Center' in the middle of a war. Arjuna is seeing 'Death' everywhere; Krishna is showing him 'Life' everywhere. By realizing this 'Ajah-Nitya' nature, the seeker moves from 'Time' to 'Timelessness.' This is not just a  idea; it is a 'Cognitive Shift.' When we look at a person, we usually see their 'Birth-date' and their 'Age.' Krishna is teaching Arjuna to see the 'Puranah' (Ancient) soul that has no age. This perspective transforms the 'Battlefield' into a 'Stage' and 'Grief' into 'Wisdom'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 2.20 is the  'Exegesis of the Self.' , 'Birth' is the association of the soul with a new body, and 'Death' is the dissociation. Neither affects the soul itself. Philosophically, this verse establishes the 'A-parinamitva' (non-transformability) of the 'Atman.' , anything that has a 'Birth' must have a 'Death.' Since the Soul is 'Ajah' (unborn), it is  'Amrita' (immortal). This verse is the  'Pinnacle of Vedantic Ontology.'</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Na-bhutva-bhavita-va-na-bhuyah' refutes the 'Theory of Momentary Existence' (Kshanika-vada). It establishes that the soul is a 'Continuous Substance' (Dravya). Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Nature of Time.' Time is a 'Category of the Mind' that applies only to the 'Asat.' The 'Atman' is 'Kala-atita' (beyond time). , 'Shashvatah' means it is not affected by the 'Three Periods of Time' (past, present, future). Philosophically, 'Puranah' is a 'Technical Term'—it means 'Pura api navah' (Ancient yet ever-new). It  explains why the sense of I feels the same at age 8 and age 80.</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Na-hanyate' (is not killed) is the 'Final Conclusion' for the warrior. , 'Himsā' (violence) is only 'Sharirika' (physical). 'Atmic Ahimsa' is an 'Axiomatic Truth.' Philosophically, this verse highlights the 'Theory of the Unchanging Reality' (Kutashtha-Nitya). , Krishna is teaching 'Sankhya' as a 'Liberating Knowledge.' This shloka is the  'Foundation of Moral Courage.' If the soul is eternal, then 'Dharma' is the only thing worth living and dying for. From a religious perspective, this shloka is the 'Song of the Spirit.' , Krishna is telling Arjuna that 'Death' is a 'Non-Event' in the history of the Soul. This verse is the ' Diamond' of the Gita—it is hard, brilliant, and indestructible. It teaches that the 'Self' is the only 'Constant' in a universe of 'Variables'.</p>
