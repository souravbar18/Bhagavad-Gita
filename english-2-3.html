        क्लैब्यं मा स्म गम: पार्थ नैतत्त्वय्युपपद्यते ।<br>

        <p>O son of Pritha, do not yield to this degrading impotence. It does not become you. Give up such petty weakness of heart and arise, O chastiser of the enemy.</p>
        
        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>In this powerful and direct command, Krishna uses words that act like sparks to reignite Arjuna's dormant warrior spirit. He calls Arjuna's condition 'klaibyam'—which literally translates to impotence or unmanliness. For a 'Kshatriya' like Arjuna, who was known for his unparalleled bravery, this is the strongest possible insult. Krishna emphasizes 'na etat tvayi upapadyate'—this does not befit you. He is reminding Arjuna of his true identity as 'Partha' (the son of Kunti/Pritha) and 'Parantapa' (the scorcher of enemies). By using these titles, Krishna contrasts Arjuna’s glorious past with his present miserable state. He identifies the root of the problem as 'kshudram hridaya-daurbalyam'—petty weakness of the heart. Arjuna thought his refusal to fight was a sign of great moral depth and saintliness, but Krishna  deconstructs it as mere emotional cowardice. He commands him to 'tyaktva' (give it up) and 'uttishtha' (arise/stand up).</p>
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Hridaya-daurbalyam' reveals a profound psychological truth. Weakness often wears the mask of virtue. We often tell ourselves we are being kind or patient when we are actually just afraid of confrontation or hard work. Krishna identifies that Arjuna is not suffering from a philosophical dilemma, but from a psychological collapse. The heart, which should be the seat of courage and 'Dharma,' has become 'Kshudram' (small or petty) due to its attachment to temporary relations. Krishna’s use of 'Parantapa' is a call to action; he is saying that a person who has conquered external enemies must not be defeated by the internal enemy of self-doubt. This verse is the ultimate antidote to procrastination and moral paralysis. It teaches that the first step to spiritual or material success is the rejection of self-imposed limitations and the victim mentality. Krishna’s roar is intended to break the spell of 'Maya' that has clouded Arjuna's 'Buddhi'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 2.3 explores the  relationship between 'Swa-dharma' (individual duty) and 'Virya' (spiritual potency). , when a 'Jiva' acts against its nature, it experiences 'Klaibyam.' Arjuna is a warrior by nature ('Guna') and profession ('Karma'). For him to behave like a non-violent monk is a  'Vikriti' (perversion) of his natural state. Philosophically, this verse establishes that true spirituality is 'Sabala' (powerful), not 'Durbala' (weak). In Vedanta, the 'Atman' is 'Abhaya' (fearless) and 'Ananta-virya' (infinitely powerful). Identifying with the 'Hridaya-daurbalyam' is a  error of 'Adhyasa' (superimposition)—projecting the weakness of the mind onto the eternal Soul. Krishna is demanding that Arjuna realize his 'Atmic' strength.</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Kshudram' (petty) vs 'Mahat' (great) is also significant. Arjuna’s grief is petty because it is based on 'I and Mine' ('Ahamkara' and 'Mamata'). Philosophically, any emotion that shrinks the consciousness to a few individuals is 'Kshudram.' True 'Mahat' consciousness encompasses the whole universe and its 'Dharmic' order. , this verse highlights the 'Doctrine of Utthana' (rising). Rising does not just mean standing up physically; it means elevating the 'Buddhi' from the 'Prakriti' (material nature) to the 'Purusha' (spiritual witness). Krishna’s command is a  'Upadesha' on 'Will-power.' He shows that the human will can be used to override the emotional turbulence of the mind. From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches that God does not help those who wallow in self-pity, but those who 'stand up' to fight for the Truth. It is a  call to 'Karma Yoga'—the path of action performed with a stable and courageous heart. This shloka serves as a timeless reminder that our greatest enemy is not external, but the 'petty weakness' that prevents us from fulfilling our divine potential.</p>
