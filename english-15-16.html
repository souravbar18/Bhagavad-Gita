        द्वाविमौ पुरुषौ लोके क्षरश्चाक्षर एव च।<br>

        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>There are two classes of beings, the fallible and the infallible. In the material world every entity is fallible, and in the spiritual world every entity is called infallible.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>In this sixteenth verse, Shri Krishna begins the final categorisation of all existence into three divisions. He introduces two types of beings (<i>Purushas</i>) in this world: the Perishable (<i>Kshara</i>) and the Imperishable (<i>Akshara</i>). Krishna clarifies that all living entities, in their material or embodied state, are considered <span class="highlight">Kshara</span> because their physical forms are subject to constant change, decay, and eventual destruction. On the other hand, the liberated souls or the underlying spiritual essence that remains unchanged amidst the fluctuations of matter is called <span class="highlight">Akshara</span> or <i>Kutastha</i> (the rock-seated/unchanging). This analysis provides a fundamental religious framework for understanding the nature of reality. It explains that everything we see around us—from the smallest insect to the largest star—belongs to the perishable category. However, there is a dimension of spirit that does not perish when the body dies. This Imperishable aspect is the silent, unchanging witness that persists through various incarnations.</p>

        <p>From a religious standpoint, this verse is a lesson in <span class="highlight">Vairagya</span> (detachment). By categorizing all material bodies as Perishable, Krishna encourages the devotee not to lament over the inevitable end of physical life. For Arjuna, this is a direct instruction to look beyond the perishable bodies of his kinsmen on the battlefield and recognize the imperishable spirit within them. This detailed analysis helps the seeker distinguish between the Clothes (the body) and the Occupant (the soul). The word <i>Kutastha</i> is particularly significant; it refers to that which stands at the peak, unaffected by the storms of the material world. By identifying with the <i>Akshara</i> rather than the <i>Kshara</i>, a devotee attains mental peace and spiritual stability. This verse prepares the ground for the introduction of the Supreme Person in the following verses, ensuring that the seeker first understands the basic duality of manifest and unmanifest existence before grasping the ultimate transcendence of God.</p>

        <h2>Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis</h2>
        <p>The philosophical weight of Shloka 16 lies in the Theory of Ontological Categorisation. , it addresses the Problem of Change and Permanence. In this religious theory, <i>Kshara</i> represents the dynamic aspect of reality—the world of becoming. , this includes the gross and subtle bodies of all Jivas. <i>Akshara</i> represents the static aspect of reality—the world of being. Philosophically, this distinction is vital for <span class="highlight">Sankhya</span> philosophy, which seeks to isolate the Purusha (spirit) from Prakriti (matter). The term <i>Kutastha</i>  implies that the soul remains unchangingly situated even while the body undergoes birth, growth, disease, and death.</p>

        <p>The significance of calling both categories Purushas is a unique  contribution of the Gita. , it suggests that even matter (in its aspect of being inhabited by souls) is a manifestation of the Divine. However, the <i>Akshara</i> is  superior because it is not subject to the cycles of <span class="highlight">Samsara</span>. This leads to the Theory of Two-Fold Existence where the seeker must learn to navigate the perishable world while anchored in the imperishable truth. Philosophically, this verse serves as a Structural Map of the cosmos. It allows the intellect to categorize experiences: This pain belongs to the Kshara, but my true self is Akshara. This  framework is essential for achieving <span class="highlight">Moksha</span> (liberation), as liberation is  defined as the transition of one's identity from the perishable to the imperishable. It represents the first step in the Yoga of the Supreme Person, moving the seeker away from the delusion of materiality toward the stability of the spirit.</p>
