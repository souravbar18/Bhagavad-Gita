        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>Everywhere are His hands and legs, His eyes, heads and faces, and He has ears everywhere. In this way the Supersoul exists, pervading everything.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>In Shloka 13.14, Lord Krishna describes the ' Omnipresence' of the Supersoul (*Paramatma*). Having defined the Absolute as beginningless, He now illustrates its ' Immanence' in the universe. The phrase 'sarvataḥ pāṇi-pādaṁ'—everywhere His hands and legs—is a ' Metaphor' for Divine activity. This analysis reveals that God is not a ' Limited Being' confined to a specific location. Instead, every ' Hand' that works in this world is powered by the ' Energy' of the Lord. Every ' Eye' that sees and every ' Ear' that hears is a ' Reflection' of the Lord's infinite perception. Krishna is teaching that the ' Supersoul' is 'sarvam āvṛitya tiṣhṭhati'—He exists by pervading everything. This shloka provides a ' Framework' for understanding Divine Omniscience. It suggests that there is no ' Corner' of the universe where God is absent. This detailed analysis focuses on the ' Connectivity' of all life. If God's hands and eyes are everywhere, then ' Privacy' from the Divine is an illusion. This shloka provides the logical structure to understand that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the totality of existence.' In our practical religious lives, this verse encourages us to see the ' Presence' of God in all living entities. It serves as a ' Foundation' for compassion; if I harm another's hand, I am  harming a hand that is ultimately owned by the Lord. The 'Detailed Analysis' of 'Loke' (in the world) indicates that this is not a ' Abstract Reality' but one that is ' Operational' in our daily experience. Krishna is describing the ' Anatomy' of the Cosmic Person. This shloka helps the seeker realize that they are never alone; the ' Knower' is always witnessing, supporting, and pervading their every movement. It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the सर्वतः पाणिपादं तत् (sarvataḥ pāṇi-pādaṁ tat),' offering the logical structure to comprehend that 'God is found in the heartbeat of the universe.' By understanding this ' Pervasiveness,' the seeker moves from a ' Localized Identity' to a ' Universal Awareness,' where the entire world is seen as the ' Body' of the Supreme.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 13.14 explores the 'Ontology of Pervasive Consciousness.' This verse introduces the ' concept' of the *Vishwarupa* (Universal Form) as a localized, indwelling reality. , the ' Individual' is a ' Subset' of the ' Universal.' Philosophically, this addresses the 'Problem of Dualism.' If God is everywhere, is there any room for ' Matter'? The answer lies in the word 'Āvṛitya' (pervading/covering). , consciousness is the ' Substratum' that ' Interpenetrates' matter without being tainted by it. The 'Deep Philosophical Significance' lies in the ' Unity' of the observer. , there are not many ' Knowers,' but one ' Supreme Knower' who manifests through many ' Portals' (the senses of living beings). This shloka provides a ' Refutation' of the idea that God is a ' Distant Judge.' It asserts that ' Justice' and ' Grace' are ' Immediate' because God is ' Internal' to the action. This verse highlights the 'Theory of Reflection' (*Bimba-Pratibimba*). , our senses are ' Borrowed' from the Divine Senses. Philosophically, the phrase 'sarvataḥ śhrutimal' (ears everywhere) highlights the ' Accessibility' of the Divine. This 'Deep Philosophical Analysis' provides the ' Foundation' for *Sarvatma-bhava*—the state of seeing oneself in all and all in oneself. This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the 'सर्वमावृत्य तिष्ठति.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the interconnectedness of all life.' It provides the logical structure to understand that 'God is found in the collective experience of the world'. , the Lord is the ' Silent Partner' in every biological function. This understanding is essential for 'Karma Yoga,' as it provides the ' Justification' for offering every action to the Lord, whose hands are already performing it. It provides the ' Clarity' to overcome the ' Illusion' of isolation, leading the seeker to the ' Bliss' of universal communion. This shloka is the ' Manifesto' of a God who is both ' Transcendental' and ' Immanent,' providing the logical structure to comprehend that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the सर्वताक्षिशिरोमुखम् (sarvatākṣi-śiro-mukham)'.</p>
