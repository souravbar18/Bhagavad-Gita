            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>In this shloka, Lord Krishna offers hope to those who may not have the capacity for deep meditation, complex philosophy, or rigorous yoga. He describes a fourth path: Shrutva-anyebhya (hearing from others). This analysis explores the  Power of Shravanam (hearing). There are many who ajanantah (not knowing these paths personally) begin their spiritual journey by hearing the truth from realized souls or authorities. Krishna states that such people, by Upasate (engaging in worship/service) based on what they have heard, also atitaranti (cross over) the realm of Mrityum (death). This religious interpretation highlights the  Efficacy of Faith (Shraddha). Not everyone is an intellectual giant or a master of focus, but everyone has the capacity to listen with sincerity. The detailed analysis of Shruti-parayanah (dedicated to hearing) suggests that the act of hearing itself becomes a  Purifier. When a person hears the descriptions of the soul, the body, and the Supreme from a genuine teacher, that sound vibration enters the heart and begins to dissolve the ignorance of Prakriti. This shloka provides the logical structure for the importance of the Guru-Shishya (Teacher-Student) tradition. It confirms that Hearing is not a secondary or lower path, but a potent  Method that leads to the same  Result—liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Krishna's compassion is evident here; He is ensuring that even the most  simple person is not excluded from the promise of immortality. By atitaranti eva, Krishna emphasizes that the crossing over is a  Certainty for those who are faithful to the wisdom they receive. This explanation underscores that spiritual success is not dependent on one's own  Brilliancy but on one's  Receptivity to the Divine Truth as transmitted through realized channels.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance:</span>
            <p>The philosophical depth of Shloka 13.25 lies in the Ontology of Sabda-Pramana (Verbal Testimony). Philosophically, this verse addresses the Problem of Access. If the Truth is beyond the senses and the mind, how can we ever find it? The answer is that the Truth descends through the word. Deep philosophical significance is found in the idea that Hearing is an act of  Submission. While meditation and Sankhya might involve a sense of personal effort or ego-intellect, hearing requires a humble  Opening of the self to an external source of light. This shloka also addresses the  Continuity of knowledge. Spiritual wisdom is not something each person must reinvent; it is a  Heritage that is passed down. Philosophically, the phrase Shruti-parayanah implies a state where the seeker's entire consciousness is  Anchored in the revealed truth. Even if they cannot see the soul yet, they  Act as if the soul is real, based on the testimony of the wise. This  Alignment eventually leads to direct experience. The religious significance is that the Supreme Lord is accessible through the ears. This is the foundation of Bhakti where hearing the glories of God (Shravanam) is the first step. The  conclusion is that Grace can work through the medium of sound. Krishna is highlighting that the Universal Truth is so  Powerful that even a distant echo of it—received through hearing—is enough to shatter the chains of mortality. This empowers the common person to believe that they too can attain the unattainable simply by listening to the Knower of the Field with a heart full of  Devotion.</p>
