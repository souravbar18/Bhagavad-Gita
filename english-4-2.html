        एवं परम्पराप्राप्तमिमं राजर्षयो विदुः |<br>

        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>This supreme science was thus received through the chain of disciplic succession, and the saintly kings understood it in that way. But in the course of time the succession was broken, and therefore the science as it is appears to be lost.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna explains the 'Entropy of Knowledge.' He says, 'evam parampara-praptam'—received (praptam) thus (evam) through the chain of succession (parampara). 'imam rajarshayo viduh'—the saintly kings (rajarshayah) knew (viduh) this (imam). 'sa kaleneha mahata'—by the great (mahata) lapse of time (kalena) here (iha). 'yogo nashtah parantapa'—the yoga (yogah) became lost (nashtah), O subduer of enemies (parantapa). This analysis focuses on the 'Vulnerability of Truth' when it enters the human sphere. Even the most sublime knowledge, if not practiced with 'Purity' and 'Discipline,' eventually fades away. Krishna identifies the 'Rajarshis' (Royal Sages) as the primary custodians of this knowledge. A 'Rajarshi' is someone who possesses the external power of a 'King' but the internal 'Wisdom' of a 'Sage.' When kings became materialistic and lost their spiritual focus, the 'Chain' (*Parampara*) was broken. The word 'Nashtah' doesn't mean the truth was destroyed, but that the 'Access' to it was lost. It became obscured by 'Interpretations,' 'Self-Interest,' and 'Atheistic tendencies.'</p>
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Parampara-praptam' (received via succession) is the ' Safeguard against Corruption.' In our practical lives, information gets distorted as it passes from one person to another. Krishna is telling Arjuna that 'Yoga' is not something that can be understood through 'Intellectual Speculation' alone; it requires a 'Living Link.' Krishna is defining 'Time' (*Kala*) as a 'Corrosive Force.' This shloka provides a 'Framework for Spiritual Restoration.' It teaches that periodically, the 'Original Message' must be 'Re-delivered' by the 'Source' (Krishna). Krishna is defining 'Lost Yoga' as 'Yoga without its Essence.' This verse is the ' Explanation for the Advent of the Gita'—it was spoken because the world had forgotten its 'Spiritual Purpose.' By using the word 'Parantapa,' Krishna encourages Arjuna to realize that 'Ignorance' is the 'True Enemy' he must conquer. This shloka is the 'Universal Reminder of the Need for Lineage,' forcing us to realize that 'We cannot find the way alone; we need the map of the ancients'. This is the ' Goal of Recovering Lost Wisdom,' where 'Modernity' meets 'Eternity'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 4.2 explores the  'Fragility of Spiritual Transmission.' , 'Wisdom' is 'Living' and requires 'Receptacles' (People) to carry it. This verse highlights the 'Theory of Devolution.' Philosophically, it addresses the 'Nature of Rajarshis.' , 'Spiritual Power' and 'Temporal Power' must be 'Integrated' for a society to flourish. When they 'Split,' the 'Yoga' is lost. This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the Interrupted Chain.'</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Kalena Mahata' (by the great time) refers to the 'Yuga-Dharma.' , as time moves from Satya Yuga to Kali Yuga, the 'Collective Consciousness' declines, making 'Truth' harder to perceive. Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Nature of Nashtah' (lost). , 'The Sun' is always there, but 'Clouds' can make it 'Lost' to our vision. This shloka is the  'End of Secular History.' , 'History' is not just a sequence of 'Events,' but a sequence of 'Consciousness States.' Philosophically, it highlights the 'Relationship between Character and Knowledge.' , if the 'Character' of the kings fails, the 'Knowledge' fails. Krishna is teaching 'Metaphysical Accountability.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches 'The Need for a Living Guru.' This verse is the ' Prerequisite for Arjuna's Initiation,' providing the logical structure to understand that 'Arjuna is the New Link' in the chain. It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Truth' must be 'Born Again' in every heart.</p>
