        यस्मात्क्षरमतीतोऽहमक्षरादपि चोत्तमः।<br>
        अतोऽस्मि लोके वेदे च प्रथितः पुरुषोत्तमः।। १५.१८ ।।

    <div class="religious-content">
        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>Because I am transcendental, beyond both the fallible and the infallible, and because I am the greatest, I am celebrated both in the world and in the Vedas as that Supreme Person.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>In this landmark eighteenth verse, Shri Krishna explicitly identifies Himself as the Supreme Reality. He says: Because I am transcendental to the perishable (<i>Kshara</i>) and even superior to the imperishable (<i>Akshara</i>), I am celebrated in the world and in the Vedas as the <span class="highlight">Purushottama</span> (the Supreme Person). This analysis is the culmination of the chapter's title. Krishna explains that His position is unique because He encompasses yet transcends both the material and the spiritual energies. He is Atitaḥ (beyond) the perishable world of change and Uttamaḥ (superior) to the unchanging liberated soul. This declaration is a direct revelation of Krishna's divinity, where He moves from being a teacher to being the very Subject of all spiritual inquiry. He confirms that this title is not a mere claim but is recognized by the Veda (the scriptures) and the Loka (the wise people of the world).</p>

        <p>From a religious standpoint, this verse defines the ultimate identity of God in the Hindu tradition. The name Purushottama is the highest title for the Divine, signifying the Best of Persons. This detailed analysis provides the devotee with absolute clarity on whom to worship. It prevents the seeker from getting stuck in the worship of minor deities or the pursuit of impersonal liberation as the final goal. Krishna is saying that the ultimate goal of all Vedic knowledge is to reach Him. This verse offers the devotee a sense of Ultimate Refuge. If Krishna is the highest of all, then surrendering to Him is the most logical and beneficial path. For Arjuna, this realization is meant to dissolve all doubts; since he is the friend and disciple of the <i>Purushottama</i> himself, he has nothing to fear. It encourages a state of unalloyed devotion where the seeker recognizes that all spiritual paths—be they through <i>Karma</i>, <i>Jnana</i>, or <i>Dhyana</i>—ultimately find their perfection in the person of Krishna. This verse is the Great Proclamation that makes the 15th chapter one of the most sacred parts of the Gita, as it gives a name and a person to the Absolute Truth.</p>

        <h2>Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis</h2>
        <p>The philosophical significance of Shloka 18 lies in the Theory of Super-Transcendence. , it establishes the Absolute Hierarchy of existence. In this religious theory, the <i>Kshara</i> (Perishable) is the domain of <i>Prakriti</i>, and the <i>Akshara</i> (Imperishable) is the domain of the <i>Atman</i>. , the <i>Purushottama</i> is the <span class="highlight">Turiya</span> (the fourth/transcendental) state that underlies and exceeds both. This addresses the Ontological Superiority of the Personal God over the Impersonal Absolute. Philosophically, it suggests that the Personal quality of God is not a limitation but a higher perfection that includes and goes beyond impersonal existence.</p>

        <p>The significance of being celebrated in the Vedas (<i>Vede cha prathitaḥ</i>) provides the  Verification of Revelation. It implies that the entire scriptural tradition is a coherent system pointing toward one person. , this verse reconciles the <i>Nirguna</i> (attribute-less) and <i>Saguna</i> (with attributes) aspects of the Divine. Krishna is <i>Nirguna</i> in His transcendence of the Gunas (Kshara) and <i>Saguna</i> in His role as the Supreme Person. This leads to the Theory of Integrated Divinity. Philosophically, it challenges the seeker to move beyond Abstract Spirituality to Relational Divinity. The  goal is the realization that the source of the universe is a Conscious Personality. This analysis provides the  justification for <span class="highlight">Bhakti Yoga</span> as the highest path, for if God is the Best Person, then Personal Relationship is the highest form of union. It represents the ultimate  Resolution of the nature of the Absolute, identifying it as the Supreme Purushottama who is the master of both the seen and the unseen worlds.</p>
