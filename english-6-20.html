        यत्रोपरमते चित्तं निरुद्धं योगसेवया |<br>

    <div class="religious-content">
        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>In the stage of perfection called trance, or samādhi, one’s mind is completely restrained from material mental activities by practice of yoga. This perfection is characterized by one’s ability to see the self by the pure mind and to relish and rejoice in the self.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna begins the 'Theoretic Exposition of Samadhi.' He says, 'yatroparamate chittaṁ'—in which (yatra) the mind (chittam) reaches quietude/ceases (uparamate). 'niruddhaṁ yoga-sevayā'—restrained (niruddham) by the practice of yoga (yoga-sevayā). 'yatra chaiva ātmanātmānaṁ'—and where (yatra cha) certainly (eva) by the self (ātmanā), the self (ātmānam). 'pashyann ātmani tuṣhyati'—seeing (pashyan) in the self (ātmani), one is satisfied (tuṣhyati). This analysis focuses on the 'Theoretic Experience of Self-Referentiality.' In the 'Theoretic Analysis of Subjectivity,' our usual satisfaction is 'Object-Dependent'—we are happy 'Because' of something. In Samadhi, the mind 'Uparamate' (Ceases its outward flow) and becomes 'Niruddham' (Contained). The revolutionary shift here is 'Ātmanātmānaṁ Pashyan'—seeing the Self by the Self. This is the 'Theoretic End of Duality.' Usually, there is a 'Seer' and a 'Seen.' In this state, the 'Instrument of Vision' (the purified mind/intellect) and the 'Object of Vision' (the soul) merge. This detailed analysis reveals that Krishna defines 'Samadhi' as a 'Closed Loop of Bliss.' This shloka provides a ' Framework for Autonomous Joy.' It teaches that 'The Soul' is its own 'Best Reward.' Krishna is telling Arjuna that the 'Yogi' stops looking for 'External Mirrors' to verify their existence. This is the ' Goal of the Self-Sufficient Consciousness,' where 'The Gaze' is 'Inward'.</p>
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Tuṣhyati' (Rejoices/Is satisfied) is the ' Description of Absolute Contentment.' In our practical lives, we are 'Thirsty.' Krishna is stating that 'The Self' is the 'Well.' Krishna is defining 'The Mind' as the 'Quietened Lake' that finally reflects the moon clearly. This shloka provides a 'Framework for Interior Satisfaction.' It teaches that 'Yoga-sevayā' (Service to Yoga) is the 'Labor' that earns the 'Leisure of the Spirit.' Krishna is defining 'Niruddham' as the 'State of Perfect Containment.' This verse is the ' Declaration of Spiritual Independence.' By using the word 'Ātmani' (In the self), He emphasizes that 'Peace' is not a 'Gift' from the outside, but an 'Uncovering' from within. This shloka is the 'Universal Manual for Substantive Happiness,' forcing us to realize that 'We are the source of our own light'. This is the ' Goal of the Contained Seeker,' where 'The Joy' is 'Internal'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 6.20 explores the  'Ontology of the Self-Sufficient Subject.' , 'Samadhi' is the 'Cessation of becoming' and the 'Start of Being.' This verse highlights the 'Theory of the Purified Perception.' Philosophically, it addresses the 'Nature of Tuṣhti' (Satisfaction). , 'Lack' is an 'Illusion' born of the mind's 'Outwardness.' When the mind 'Returns' to the Self, 'Fullness' (*Purnatva*) is realized. This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the Sovereign Joy.'</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Yoga-sevayā' refers to 'The Cumulative Power of Practice.' , 'Yoga' is not a 'One-time Event' but a 'Steady Cultivation.' Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Nature of Pashyan' (Seeing). , 'Seeing' is not 'Visual' but 'Experiential Knowledge.' To see the Self is to 'Know' the Self as 'Distinct' from the 'Ego.' This shloka is the  'End of Identity Crisis.' , the Yogi finally answers the question 'Who am I?' not with a 'Name' but with a 'State of Being.' Philosophically, it highlights the 'Relationship between Restraint and Revelation.' , the 'Self' reveals itself only when the 'Mind' stops 'Shouting.' Krishna is teaching 'Metaphysical Stillness.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches 'The Sanctity of the Internal Life.' This verse is the ' Proof that we have an infinite world within us,' providing the logical structure to understand that 'God is the deepest layer of our own existence'. It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the Silence'.</p>
