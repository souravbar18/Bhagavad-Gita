        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>Although the Supersoul appears to be divided among all beings, He is never divided. He is situated as one. Although He is the maintainer of every living entity, it is to be understood that He devours and develops all.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>In Shloka 13.17, Lord Krishna describes the ' Unity' of the Divine amidst the ' Multiplicity' of the material world. He states that the Lord is 'avibhaktaṁ'—undivided—yet 'vibhaktaṁ iva cha sthitam'—appears as if divided among all beings. This analysis reveals the ' Illusion' of separation. Just as the one ' Sun' appears in many different ' Reflections' in many different pots of water, the one ' Supersoul' appears as a distinct ' Witness' in every heart. However, the ' Reality' is that the Sun is never divided. This shloka provides a ' Framework' for understanding the ' Singularity' of consciousness. This detailed analysis focuses on the ' Triple Function' of the Divine: 'bhūta-bhartṛi' (the maintainer), 'grasiṣhṇu' (the devourer), and 'prabhaviṣhṇu' (the generator). This shloka provides the logical structure to understand that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the cycles of existence.' In our practical religious lives, this verse teaches us that God is the ' Source' of our birth, the ' Support' of our life, and the ' Destination' of our death. The 'Detailed Analysis' of 'Grasiṣhṇu' (Devourer) indicates that even ' Destruction' is a ' Act' of the Divine, making way for new creation ('Prabhaviṣhṇu'). This shloka helps the seeker realize that the ' Diversification' of life is a ' Superficiality.' It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the अविभक्तं च भूतेषु' offering the logical structure to comprehend that 'God is found in the underlying oneness.' By understanding this ' Unity,' the seeker moves from a ' Egoic Identity' that sees itself as separate to a ' Divine Identity' that sees the same one Lord everywhere. This shloka is the ' Key' to the three-fold ' Majesty' of God as Creator, Maintainer, and Destroyer, providing the logical structure to comprehend that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the ग्रसिष्णु प्रभविष्णु च'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 13.17 explores the 'Ontology of Indivisibility.' This verse introduces the ' concept' of the *Akhanda* (Unbroken) reality. , Brahman is ' Non-Fragmentable.' Philosophically, this addresses the 'Problem of the One and the Many.' If God is in everyone, did He split Himself into ' Pieces'? The answer is 'Vibhaktaṁ iva'—it only *appears* so. The 'Deep Philosophical Significance' lies in the ' Definition' of *Bhūta-bhartṛi*. , the Lord is the ' Support' (*Adhara*) of the ' Supported' (*Adheya*). This shloka provides a ' Refutation' of the idea that individual souls are ' Independent Atoms' of consciousness. It asserts that ' Individuality' is a ' Limitation' of the body, not of the spirit. This verse highlights the 'Theory of Cosmic Cycles.' , the universe is a ' Breath' of the Divine—expanding (generation), staying (maintenance), and contracting (devouring). Philosophically, the phrase 'grasiṣhṇu' highlights the ' Finality' of the material field. This 'Deep Philosophical Analysis' provides the ' Foundation' for 'Vishwa-rupa' meditation. This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the 'বিভক্তমিব চ স্থিতম্.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the stillness that survives destruction.' It provides the logical structure to understand that 'God is found in the wholeness of reality'. , the Lord is the ' Constant' in a universe of variables. This understanding is essential for 'Shanti' (peace), as it provides the ' Assurance' that nothing is ever truly lost, only ' Reabsorbed' into the Source. It provides the ' Clarity' to overcome the ' Fear' of death, leading the seeker to the ' Bliss' of being ' One' with the Eternal. This shloka is the ' Finality' of the Lord's maintenance role, providing the logical structure to comprehend that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the भूतभर्तृ च तज्ज्ञेयं'.</p>
