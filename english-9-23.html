        येऽप्यन्यदेवताभक्ता यजन्ते श्रद्धयान्विता: |<br>

        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>Those who are devotees of other gods and who worship them with faith actually worship only Me, O son of Kunti, but they do so in a wrong way.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna identifies the 'Theoretic Error of Indirect Worship.' He says, 'ye ’py anya-devatā-bhaktā'—those who are (ye api) devotees of other gods (anya-devatā-bhaktāḥ). 'yajante śhraddhayānvitāḥ'—and worship (yajante) endowed with faith (śhraddhayā-anvitāḥ). 'te ’pi mām eva kaunteya'—they also (te api) worship only Me (mām eva), O son of Kunti. 'yajanty avidhi-pūrvakam'—but they worship (yajanti) in an irregular/wrong way (avidhi-pūrvakam). This analysis focuses on the 'Theoretic Centrality of the Supreme.' Krishna explains that because He is the 'Antaryami' (Inner witness) of all beings and the source of all power, any sacrifice offered to any power eventually reaches Him. In the 'Theoretic Framework of Divine Source,' all 'Devas' (Celestial beings) are like department heads in a government where Krishna is the President. This detailed analysis reveals that Krishna defines 'Avidhi-pūrvakam' (Irregularly) not as a sin of malice, but as a 'Cognitive Mistake.' It is like sending a letter to a branch office when it should go to the headquarters. This shloka provides a ' Framework for Inclusive Monotheism.' It teaches that while the Lord recognizes the 'Faith' (Śhraddhā), He points out the 'Inefficiency' of the method. Krishna is telling Arjuna that 'People who worship other deities with faith are really worshiping Me, but they don't realize the source, so their method is flawed.' This is the ' Goal of the Indirect Seeker,' where 'The Source' is 'Obscured'.</p>
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Avidhi-pūrvakam' (Irregularly) is the 'Theoretic Description of Spiritual Circuitry.' In our practical lives, we often 'Middle-man' our needs. Krishna is stating that direct connection is the 'Vidhi' (Correct method). Krishna is defining 'The Self' as the 'One who is the ultimate recipient of all devotion.' This shloka provides a 'Framework for the Hierarchy of Power.' It teaches that 'Anya-devatā' (Other gods) are manifestations of His energy, but not His 'Full Presence.' Krishna is defining 'Śhraddhā' as the saving grace—it is the faith that makes the worship reach Him despite the wrong address. This verse is the ' Proof that all sincere religious impulse is directed toward the Absolute.' By using the word 'Kaunteya,' He instructs Arjuna in the science of 'Direct Bhakti.' This shloka is the 'Universal Manual for the Spiritual Seeker,' forcing us to realize that 'We should not stop at the tributaries when we can go to the Ocean'. This is the ' Goal of the Direct Seeker,' where 'The Connection' is 'Streamlined'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 9.23 explores the  'Ontology of Indirect Causality.' , God is the 'Final Cause' (*Param Karana*) of all rituals. This verse highlights the 'Theory of the Wrong Address.' Philosophically, it addresses the 'Nature of Faith' (*Śhraddhā*). , faith is always valid, but 'Knowledge' (*Vidhi*) determines the speed of liberation. This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the Irregular Path.'</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Mām eva' refers to 'The Philosophy of the Sole Reality.' , there is only 'One' to worship. Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Nature of the Devas.' , the Devas are 'Functional Aspects' of the Divine. This shloka is the  'End of Fragmented Worship.' , worshiping the 'Part' as the 'Whole' is 'Avidhi.' Philosophically, it highlights the 'Relationship between the Root and the Leaves.' , watering the leaves (deities) reaches the root (Krishna), but it is more efficient to water the root directly. Krishna is teaching 'Metaphysical Economics.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches 'The Supremacy of Krishna-Bhakti.' This verse is the ' Proof that all paths lead to Him, but some are unnecessarily long,' providing the logical structure to understand that 'God is found in the directness of the gaze'. It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the Vidhi'.</p>
