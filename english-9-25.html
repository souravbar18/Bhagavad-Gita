        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods; those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors; those who worship ghosts and spirits will take birth among such beings; and those who worship Me will live with Me.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna identifies the 'Theoretic Law of Attraction and Destination.' He says, 'yānti deva-vratā devān'—those who vow to the gods (deva-vratāḥ) go (yānti) to the gods (devān). 'pitṛīn yānti pitṛi-vratāḥ'—those who vow to the ancestors (pitṛi-vratāḥ) go to the ancestors (pitṛīn). 'bhūtāni yānti bhūtejyā'—the worshipers of spirits (bhūtejyāḥ) go to the spirits (bhūtāni). 'yānti mad-yājino ’pi mām'—those who sacrifice to Me (mad-yājinaḥ) also (api) go to Me (mām). This analysis focuses on the 'Theoretic Geometry of Intent.' Krishna explains that the soul is a 'Vibrational Entity' that aligns itself with the object of its focus. In the 'Theoretic Framework of Post-Mortem Existence,' your destination is determined by your 'Vrata' (Vow/Commitment). This detailed analysis reveals that Krishna defines 'Worship' as a 'Navigation System.' The universe is multi-layered, and your choice of deity is essentially your choice of destination. This shloka provides a ' Framework for Spiritual Free Will.' It teaches that God does not 'Send' us anywhere; we 'Go' where we have invested our consciousness. Krishna is telling Arjuna that 'If you aim for the temporary, you get the temporary; if you aim for the Eternal, you get the Eternal.' This is the ' Goal of the Strategic Seeker,' where 'The Alignment' is 'Calculated'.</p>
            
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Mad-yājinaḥ' (My worshipers) is the 'Theoretic Description of the Ultimate Homecoming.' In our practical lives, we often wonder why results vary despite similar effort. Krishna is stating that the 'Target' of the effort is the deciding factor. Krishna is defining 'The Self' as the 'One who is shaped by its devotions.' This shloka provides a 'Framework for the Consequence of Desire.' It teaches that 'Bhūtejyā' (Worship of lower spirits) leads to lower dimensions of reality. Krishna is defining 'Vrata' as the 'Mental Gravity' that pulls the soul toward a specific sphere. This verse is the ' Proof that spiritual life is not a gamble but a law of causality.' By using the word 'Api' (Also), He emphasizes that even among all these options, the path to Him is equally available. This shloka is the 'Universal Manual for the Conscious Soul,' forcing us to realize that 'We are currently creating our future environment by the quality of our current adoration'. This is the ' Goal of the Far-Sighted Seeker,' where 'The End' is 'Secured'.</p>
