        वेदाहं समतीतानि वर्तमानानि चार्जुन |<br>

    <div class="religious-content">
        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>O Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that has happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are yet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me no one knows.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna identifies Himself as the 'Theoretic Master of Time and Space.' He says, 'vedāhaṁ samatītāni'—know (veda) I (aham) the past (samatītāni). 'vartamānāni chārjuna'—and the present (vartamānāni cha), O Arjuna. 'bhaviṣhyāṇi cha bhūtāni'—and the future (bhaviṣhyāṇi cha) living beings (bhūtāni). 'māṁ tu veda na kaśhchana'—Me (mām) but (tu) knows (veda) no one (na kaśhchana). This analysis focuses on the 'Theoretic Omniscience of the Absolute.' Krishna contrasts His own 'Infinite Knowledge' with the 'Finite Knowledge' of the soul. In the 'Theoretic Framework of Temporal Perspective,' humans are trapped in the 'Now,' with fading memories of the 'Then' and total ignorance of the 'Soon.' Krishna, however, stands outside of Time, seeing the entire timeline as a single map. This detailed analysis reveals that Krishna defines 'The Divine Advantage' as the 'Total View.' This shloka provides a ' Framework for Divine Authority.' It teaches that God's advice is reliable because He has already seen the 'Ending.' Krishna is telling Arjuna that 'I know you better than you know yourself because I have watched you through all your lifetimes.' This is the ' Goal of the Surrendering Seeker,' where 'The Trust' is 'Absolute'.</p>
            
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Māṁ tu veda na kaśhchana' (But Me no one knows) is the 'Theoretic Description of the One-Way Knowledge.' In our practical lives, a 'Parent' knows the infant, but the 'Infant' does not truly know the parent. Krishna is stating that the 'Subject' (God) knows all 'Objects' (Souls), but the 'Objects' cannot encompass the 'Subject.' Krishna is defining 'The Self' as the 'Unknowable Knower.' This shloka provides a 'Framework for Intellectual Humility.' It teaches that our 'Small Brains' cannot contain the 'Infinite Mind.' Krishna is defining 'Bhūtāni' (Living Beings) as the 'Content' of His awareness. This verse is the ' Proof that God is the Witness of History.' By using the word 'Arjuna,' He personalizes this vast metaphysical truth for His friend. This shloka is the 'Universal Manual for the Seeking Soul,' forcing us to realize that 'We are completely transparent to God, even while God remains a mystery to us'. This is the ' Goal of the Humble Seeker,' where 'The Awareness' is 'Divine'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 7.26 explores the  'Ontology of Omniscience.' , 'Knowledge' is a function of 'Presence.' Since God is 'Everywhere,' He 'Knows Everything.' This verse highlights the 'Theory of the Simultaneous Perception.' Philosophically, it addresses the 'Nature of Time.' , 'Time' is a 'Material Energy' (*Kāla*) that affects the soul but does not affect the Lord. This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the Timeless Awareness.'</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Samatītāni' (Past) and 'Bhaviṣhyāṇi' (Future) refers to 'The Philosophy of Pre-determination and Free Will.' , God 'Knows' the future without 'Compelling' it. Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Nature of the Divine Person.' , God is not a 'Part' of the world's history; He is the 'Author' of it. This shloka is the  'End of Secular Privacy.' , there is no 'Secret' from the Absolute. Philosophically, it highlights the 'Relationship between the Observer and the Observed.' , the 'Observer' (Krishna) is 'Independent,' while the 'Observed' (Beings) are 'Dependent.' Krishna is teaching 'Metaphysical Supremacy.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches 'The Comfort of Divine Guidance.' This verse is the ' Proof that we are never alone,' providing the logical structure to understand that 'God is found in the memory of the past and the hope of the future'. It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the Knowing'.</p>
