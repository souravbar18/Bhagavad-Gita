        <p>Others, who engage in sacrifice by the cultivation of knowledge, worship the Supreme Lord as the one without a second, as diverse in many, and in the universal form.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna identifies the 'Theoretic Diversity of Worship through Knowledge.' He says, 'jñāna-yajñena chāpy anye'—others (anye) also (cha api) worship (upāsate) by the sacrifice of knowledge (jñāna-yajñena). 'yajanto mām upāsate'—sacrificing (yajantaḥ), they worship Me (mām). 'ekatvena pṛithaktvena'—in oneness (ekatvena) and in diversity (pṛithaktvena). 'bahudhā viśhvato-mukham'—in many ways (bahudhā) as the universal form (viśhvato-mukham). This analysis focuses on the 'Theoretic Spectrum of Spiritual Perception.' Krishna explains that while the Mahatmas (described in previous verses) worship Him through direct devotion, there are intellectuals who approach Him through the 'Sacrifice of the Mind.' In the 'Theoretic Framework of Multi-Dimensional Divinity,' there are three primary modes of this knowledge-sacrifice: *Advaita* (Oneness), *Dvaita* or *Vishishtadvaita* (Difference/Parts), and *Vishvarupa* (The Universal Form). This detailed analysis reveals that Krishna defines 'Worship' as a flexible engagement with Truth. The phrase 'Viśhvato-mukham' (Facing all directions) implies that God is present in all perspectives. This shloka provides a ' Framework for Inclusive Epistemology.' It teaches that different levels of understanding are all valid 'Yajnas' if directed toward Him. Krishna is telling Arjuna that 'Some see Me as the Absolute One, some see Me in the variety of the world, and some see Me as the Cosmos itself—all are approaching Me.' This is the ' Goal of the Broad-Minded Seeker,' where 'The Narrowness' is 'Dissolved'.</p>
            
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Jñāna-yajñena' is the 'Theoretic Description of Intellectual Devotion.' In our practical lives, we often separate 'Study' from 'Prayer.' Krishna is stating that 'Inquiry' is a form of 'Offering.' Krishna is defining 'The Self' as the 'One who can be perceived through various philosophical lenses.' This shloka provides a 'Framework for the Unity of Paths.' It teaches that 'Ekatvena' (Monism) and 'Pṛithaktvena' (Dualism) are not necessarily contradictory but are different ' Resolutions' of the same Infinite Reality. Krishna is defining 'Bahudhā' as the 'Multiplicity' of Divine expression. This verse is the ' Proof that the Lord accepts all sincere intellectual inquiries.' By using the word 'Upāsate,' He emphasizes that even the philosopher must eventually reach a state of 'Worship.' This shloka is the 'Universal Manual for the Intellectual Soul,' forcing us to realize that 'Philosophy is not just an academic exercise; it is a ritual to find the Face that is everywhere'. This is the ' Goal of the Integral Seeker,' where 'The Perspective' is 'Unified'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 9.15 explores the  'Ontology of the Many-Faced Divine.' , the Absolute is 'Non-Dual' but 'Experientially Diverse.' This verse highlights the 'Theory of Relative Truths within the Absolute.' Philosophically, it addresses the 'Nature of Knowledge' (*Jnana*). , knowledge is a 'Yajna' because it requires the burning of ignorance in the fire of awareness. This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the Universal Form.'</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Viśhvato-mukham' refers to 'The Philosophy of Panentheism.' , everything we see is a 'Face' of God. Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Nature of Oneness' (*Ekatvena*). , the realization of 'I am He' (So-ham) is one valid sacrifice. This shloka is the  'End of Dogmatic Rigidity.' , different philosophical schools are simply 'Sacrifices' offered at different altars of the same Truth. Philosophically, it highlights the 'Relationship between the Knower and the Known.' , the Knower (Seeker) uses his intellect to bridge the gap to the Known (God). Krishna is teaching 'Metaphysical Pluralism.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches 'The Universality of the Lord.' This verse is the ' Proof that all paths of knowledge eventually intersect at the Divine,' providing the logical structure to understand that 'God is found in the breadth of the intellect'. It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the Jñāna-yajñe'.</p>
