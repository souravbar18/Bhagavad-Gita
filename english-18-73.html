        <p>Arjuna said: My dear Krishna, O infallible one, my illusion is now gone. I have regained my memory by Your grace. I am now firm and free from doubt and am prepared to act according to Your instruction.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>This verse is the climax of Arjuna's journey and the ultimate success of the Gita. Arjuna replies with deep conviction: nashto mohah—my illusion is destroyed; smritir labdha—my memory is regained. He acknowledges that this has happened tvat-prasadat—through Your grace, O Achyuta. He declares his new state: sthito ’smi—I am standing firm; gata-sandehah—my doubts have vanished. Finally, he gives his word: karishye vachanam tava—I will act according to Your word. This verse is the Siddhi or the fulfillment of the entire Gita. For a Hindu, it represents the ideal transformation of a seeker. The analysis reveals that the loss of memory mentioned here is the loss of the soul's awareness of its divine nature and its duty. By regaining this Smriti, Arjuna returns to his true self. Krishna is identifying that intellectual clarity must lead to resolute action. This verse serves as a model for surrender; it proves that real surrender is not about losing one's will, but about aligning it with the Divine Will. The term Achyuta (Infallible) is used by Arjuna to acknowledge that the Lord's guidance is perfect and never fails. Arjuna's diagnosis proves that doubt (Sandeha) is the paralyzer of the soul, while grace (Prasada) is the awakener. This shloka provides a standard for spiritual progress. It encourages the individual to reach a point where they can confidently say I will act based on divine wisdom. It reinforces the idea that the end goal of spirituality is not just inner peace, but righteous action in the world. By saying I will act according to Your word, Arjuna accepts his role in the battle of life with a new perspective. He is no longer fighting for himself, but as an instrument of the Divine. Thus, the Gita teaches that when the mind is clear and the heart is surrendered, all conflicts disappear. Therefore, the restoration of spiritual memory is the ultimate cure for the disease of worldliness. This verse is a celebration of the human spirit's return to its divine origin. In summary, Arjuna's words are the highest praise a teacher can receive—the total transformation of the student from a state of breakdown to a state of absolute readiness.</p>
