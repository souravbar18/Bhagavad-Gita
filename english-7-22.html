        स तया श्रद्धया युक्तस्तस्याराधनमीहते |<br>

        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>Endowed with such faith, he endeavors to worship a particular demigod and obtains his desires. But in actuality these benefits are bestowed by Me alone.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna explains the 'Theoretic Culmination of Delegated Worship.' He says, 'sa tayā śhraddhayā yuktaḥ'—he (saḥ) with that (tayā) faith (śhraddhayā) endowed (yuktaḥ). 'tasyārādhanam īhate'—desires (īhate) worship (ārādhanam) of that deity (tasya). 'labhate cha tataḥ kāmān'—and obtains (labhate cha) from there (tataḥ) his desires (kāmān). 'mayaiva vihitān hi tān'—indeed (hi) those (tān) arranged (vihitān) by Me alone (mayā eva). This analysis focuses on the 'Theoretic Source of All Boons.' While the seeker thinks the 'Demigod' is the giver, Krishna clarifies that the 'Demigod' has no independent power to grant anything. In the 'Theoretic Framework of Divine Administration,' demigods are like 'Bank Officers' who can approve a loan, but the 'Money' belongs to the 'Government' (Krishna). This detailed analysis reveals that Krishna defines 'The Universe' as a 'Single-Accounting System.' This shloka provides a ' Framework for the Mechanism of Prayer Answered.' It teaches that every 'Success' in the world is a 'Subsidized Gift' from the Supreme. Krishna is telling Arjuna that 'Even when people don't know it is Me, I am the one signing the checks of their lives.' This is the ' Goal of the Benefited Seeker,' where 'The Source' is 'Supreme'.</p>
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Mayā eva vihitān' (Arranged by Me alone) is the 'Theoretic Description of the Secret Giver.' In our practical lives, we thank the 'Doctor' for the cure, but the 'Healing Power' is Divine. Krishna is stating that 'Credit' should eventually return to the 'Origin.' Krishna is defining 'The Self' as the 'Hidden Benefactor.' This shloka provides a 'Framework for Deep Gratitude.' It teaches that we should look 'Behind the Person' to see the 'Presence.' Krishna is defining 'Kāmān' (Desires) as the 'Goods' delivered through 'Secondary Channels.' This verse is the ' Proof that there is only one true 'Provider' in existence.' By using the word 'Ihate' (Endeavors), He acknowledges the 'Effort' of the devotee but places the 'Result' in His own hands. This shloka is the 'Universal Manual for the Successful Soul,' forcing us to realize that 'Every door that opens for us was unlocked by the same Master Key'. This is the ' Goal of the Gratified Seeker,' where 'The Origin' is 'Identified'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 7.22 explores the  'Ontology of the Delegated Authority.' , 'Power' is not 'Possessed' by anyone other than the 'Absolute.' This verse highlights the 'Theory of the Cosmic Hierarchy.' Philosophically, it addresses the 'Nature of Mediated Grace.' , 'Demigods' are 'Instruments' used by the Divine to 'Fulfill the Karma' of the individuals. This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the Absolute Monopoly of Good.'</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Tayā śhraddhayā' refers to 'The Philosophy of the Guided Will.' , once the 'Faith' is fixed (by Shloka 21), the 'Action' (Aradhana) follows, and the 'Result' (Labha) is guaranteed. Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Nature of the Divine Law.' , the universe 'Responds' to faith because the 'Source' of the universe is 'Faith-Sustained.' This shloka is the  'End of Independence.' , even a 'God' cannot give what 'God' does not provide. Philosophically, it highlights the 'Relationship between the Giver, the Receiver, and the Gift.' , Krishna is the 'Ultimate Giver' and 'Ultimate Gift.' Krishna is teaching 'Metaphysical Honesty.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches 'The Interconnectivity of All Worship.' This verse is the ' Proof that all paths eventually point to one center,' providing the logical structure to understand that 'God is found in every answered prayer'. It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the Bestowal'.</p>
