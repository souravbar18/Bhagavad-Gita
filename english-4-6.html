        अजोऽपि सन्नव्ययात्मा भूतानामीश्वरोऽपि सन् |<br>

        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>Although I am unborn and My transcendental body never deteriorates, and although I am the Lord of all living entities, I still appear in every millennium in My original transcendental form.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna explains the 'Nature of His Appearance.' He says, 'ajo 'pi sann avyayatma'—although (api) being (san) unborn (ajah) and 'imperishable in nature' (avyaya-atma). 'bhutanam ishvaro 'pi san'—although (api) being (san) the Lord (ishvarah) of all living beings (bhutanam). 'prakritim svam adhishthaya'—presiding over (adhishthaya) My own (svam) material nature (prakritim). 'sambhavamy atma-mayaya'—I manifest (sambhavami) by My own internal potency (atma-mayaya). This analysis focuses on the 'Mechanism of Incarnation.' Krishna clarifies that He does not 'Take Birth' like a human under the compulsion of Karma. Instead, He 'Manifests' (*Sambhavami*). He remains 'Ajah' (unborn) because His essence never enters the cycle of decay. When He appears, He does not become 'Subject' to Prakriti; rather, He 'Presides' (*Adhishthaya*) over it. He uses His 'Atma-Maya'—His divine, internal energy—to create a form that looks physical to us but is actually purely spiritual. This is the 'Doctrine of the Spiritual Body.' Unlike a *Jiva* whose body is a prison made by external Prakriti, the Lord's form is a 'Tool' projected by His own will.</p>
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Atma-Mayaya' is the ' Description of Divine Agency.' In our practical lives, we are moved by the 'Gunas' (modes of nature). Krishna is stating that He moves the 'Gunas.' Krishna is defining the 'Avatar' as the 'Master of the Matrix.' This shloka provides a 'Framework for Transcendental Descent.' It teaches that the Lord's 'Birth' is a 'Divine Drama' (Lila). Krishna is defining 'Avyayatma' to show that His consciousness and identity remain absolute even when He appears as a child in Vrindavan or a warrior on Kurukshetra. This verse is the ' Solution to the Paradox' of the Infinite appearing as Finite. By using the phrase 'Prakritim Svam,' He reminds us that all of Nature belongs to Him, and He is its Sovereign. This shloka is the 'Universal Proclamation of Divine Freedom,' forcing us to realize that 'God is not trapped in the world He created'. This is the ' Goal of Understanding Divine Play,' where 'Matter' is 'Spirit’s Instrument'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 4.6 explores the  'Sovereignty of Spirit over Matter.' , the 'Creator' cannot be 'Captured' by the 'Creation.' This verse highlights the 'Theory of Volitional Appearance.' Philosophically, it addresses the 'Nature of Atma-Maya.' , 'Maya' is usually the 'Illusion' that binds souls, but 'Atma-Maya' is the 'Power' by which the Lord reveals Himself. This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the Self-Projected Form.'</p>
            
            <p>The  framework of 'Adhishthaya' (presiding/governing) refers to the 'Superiority of the Self.' , the Lord remains the 'Controller' even in His 'Human-like' activities. Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Nature of Ajah' (unborn). , 'Birth' implies a 'Beginning' and a 'Cause.' Since the Lord is 'Anadi' (without beginning) and the 'Cause of all Causes,' His 'Janma' is not a birth but a 'Visibility.' This shloka is the  'End of Materialistic Interpretation of God.' , to judge the Avatar by material standards is to miss the 'Atma-Maya.' Philosophically, it highlights the 'Relationship between Essence and Appearance.' , the 'Essence' remains 'Avyaya' while the 'Appearance' changes. Krishna is teaching 'Metaphysical Sovereignty.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches 'The Supremacy of Krishna as the Purushottama.' This verse is the ' Foundation of Deity Worship,' providing the logical structure to understand that 'The Form of the Lord is Divine'. It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Absolute' is both 'Nirguna' (formless) and 'Saguna' (with form) simultaneously.</p>
