        महात्मानस्तु मां पार्थ दैवीं प्रकृतिमाश्रिता: |<br>

        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>O son of Prtha, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna identifies the 'Theoretic Character of the Great Soul.' He says, 'mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha'—the great souls (mahātmānaḥ) but (tu), O Partha. 'daivīṁ prakṛitim āśhritāḥ'—have taken shelter (āśhritāḥ) in the divine (daivīm) nature (prakṛitim). 'bhajanty ananya-manaso'—engage in devotional service (bhajanti) with undistracted/one-pointed (ananya) mind (manasaḥ). 'jñātvā bhūtādim avyayam'—knowing (jñātvā) Me as the source of all beings (bhūta-ādim) and inexhaustible (avyayam). This analysis focuses on the 'Theoretic Path of the Mahatma.' Krishna explains that a 'Great Soul' is not someone who is merely famous or powerful, but someone who has shifted their 'Shelter' from the material energy to the Divine Energy. In the 'Theoretic Framework of Devotional One-Pointedness,' the mind becomes 'Ananya'—having no other goal. This detailed analysis reveals that Krishna defines 'Greatness' as 'Divine Dependency.' The word 'Bhajanti' implies a loving engagement. This shloka provides a ' Framework for the Sanity of the Seeker.' It teaches that recognizing God as the 'Avyayam' (Inexhaustible) source is the root of all spiritual strength. Krishna is telling Arjuna that 'The Mahatmas are those who see the truth and focus their entire being on it because they know where everything comes from.' This is the ' Goal of the Devoted Seeker,' where 'The Distraction' is 'Eliminated'.</p>
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Daivīṁ Prakṛitim' (Divine Nature) is the 'Theoretic Description of Spiritual Protection.' In our practical lives, we are 'Sheltered' by money, health, or family. Krishna is stating that the 'Mahatma' is sheltered by the 'Daivi' (Divine) potency. Krishna is defining 'The Self' as the 'One who is one-pointed in the Truth.' This shloka provides a 'Framework for the Ultimate Sanity.' It teaches that 'Ananya-manaso' (One-pointed mind) is the result of 'Jnana' (Knowledge) of the Source. Krishna is defining 'Bhūta-ādim' (Source of all) as the 'Primordiality' of His being. This verse is the ' Proof that greatness is a matter of inner orientation.' By using the word 'Pārtha,' He calls Arjuna to his nobility. This shloka is the 'Universal Manual for the Aspiring Mahatma,' forcing us to realize that 'We become what we rely on; relying on the Infinite makes us great'. This is the ' Goal of the One-Pointed Seeker,' where 'The Connection' is 'Permanent'.</p>

            <p>The  framework of 'Ananya-manaso' refers to 'The Philosophy of Single-Minded Focus.' , the mind is a 'Magnifying Glass'; when focused, it ignites the flame of liberation. Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Nature of the Inexhaustible' (*Avyayam*). , the source does not 'Diminish' by giving. This shloka is the  'End of Spiritual Duality.' , the Mahatma sees 'Only One' where the fool sees 'Many.' Philosophically, it highlights the 'Relationship between Knowledge and Love.' , knowing Him as the 'Bhūta-ādim' naturally leads to 'Bhajanti.' Krishna is teaching 'Metaphysical Integration.'
