        येषां त्वन्तगतं पापं जनानां पुण्यकर्मणाम् |<br>
        ते द्वन्द्वमोहनिर्मुक्ता भजन्ते मां दृढव्रता: || ७.२८ ||

    <div class="religious-content">
        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life and whose sins are completely eradicated are freed from the dualities of delusion, and they engage themselves in My service with determination.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna identifies the 'Theoretic Path to Liberation.' He says, 'yeṣhāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ'—those (yeṣhāṁ) whose sins (pāpaṁ) have come to an end (anta-gataṁ). 'janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām'—of persons (janānāṁ) who perform pious actions (puṇya-karmaṇām). 'te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā'—they (te) are freed (nirmuktāḥ) from the delusion of dualities (dvandva-moha). 'bhajante māṁ dṛiḍha-vratāḥ'—worship (bhajante) Me (māṁ) with fixed determination (dṛiḍha-vratāḥ). This analysis focuses on the 'Theoretic Correlation between Ethics and Enlightenment.' Krishna explains that 'Knowledge' is not just an intellectual achievement; it is a 'Moral' achievement. In the 'Theoretic Framework of Karmic Purification,' sin is like 'Dust' on a mirror. As long as the dust of past misdeeds remains, the mirror cannot reflect the Divine. This detailed analysis reveals that Krishna defines 'Virtue' as the 'Solvent of Delusion.' When sins are washed away through 'Puṇya-karma' (pious deeds), the soul naturally stops oscillating between desire and hate. This shloka provides a ' Framework for Spiritual Stability.' It teaches that 'Determination' (*Dṛiḍha-vrata*) is the result of a 'Clean Heart.' Krishna is telling Arjuna that only those who have lived lives of service and integrity can stay focused on the Absolute without being distracted by worldly drama. This is the ' Goal of the Purified Seeker,' where 'The Focus' is 'Unyielding'.</p>
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Dṛiḍha-vratāḥ' (Fixed Determination) is the 'Theoretic Description of Spiritual Maturity.' In our practical lives, we start many things but finish few. Krishna is stating that 'Consistency' is the hallmark of the 'Sinless.' Krishna is defining 'The Self' as the 'One who has reconciled its past.' This shloka provides a 'Framework for the Value of Purity.' It teaches that 'Good Deeds' are not just for 'Heaven' but for 'Clarity' here and now. Krishna is defining 'Nirmuktāḥ' (Liberated) as a present-tense reality for the pious. This verse is the ' Proof that morality is the ladder to metaphysics.' By using the word 'Tu' (But), He creates a sharp contrast with the 'Mūḍhaḥ' of previous verses. This shloka is the 'Universal Manual for the Virtuous Soul,' forcing us to realize that 'We cannot see God if we are busy hurting His creation'. This is the ' Goal of the Pious Seeker,' where 'The Mirror' is 'Cleaned'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 7.28 explores the  'Ontology of the Purified Agency.' , 'Free Will' is fully exercised only when the 'Weight of Sin' is removed. This verse highlights the 'Theory of the Moral Precondition.' Philosophically, it addresses the 'Nature of Puṇya-karma.' , 'Pious Action' is anything that 'Reduces Ego' and 'Increases Unity.' This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the Unshakable Resolve.'</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ' (Ended Sin) refers to 'The Philosophy of Karmic Exhaustion.' , a soul reaches this stage through 'Sadhana' (practice) over many lives. Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Nature of the Divine Service' (*Bhajante*). , 'Worship' is not a 'Burden' for the pure; it is their 'Natural State.' This shloka is the  'End of Hypocrisy.' , you cannot be a 'Devotee' and a 'Sinner' simultaneously, for 'Sin' is the 'Negation of Devotion.' Philosophically, it highlights the 'Relationship between the Action and the Awareness.' , 'Clean Action' leads to 'Clear Awareness.' Krishna is teaching 'Metaphysical Integrity.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches 'The Power of a Dedicated Life.' This verse is the ' Proof that holiness is the only path to sanity,' providing the logical structure to understand that 'God is found in the heart that has stopped fighting reality'. It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the Good'.</p>
