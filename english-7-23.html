        अन्तवत्तु फलं तेषां तद्भवत्यल्पमेधसाम् |<br>

    <div class="religious-content">
        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>Men of small intelligence worship the demigods, and their fruits are limited and temporary. Those who worship the demigods go to the planets of the demigods, but My devotees ultimately reach My supreme planet.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna delivers the 'Theoretic Verdict on Material vs. Spiritual Results.' He says, 'antavat tu phalaṁ teṣhāṁ'—finite/temporary (antavat) but (tu) the fruit (phalaṁ) of them (teṣhāṁ). 'tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām'—that (tad) becomes (bhavati) of those of small intelligence (alpa-medhasām). 'devān deva-yajo yānti'—to the demigods (devān) the worshippers of demigods (deva-yajaḥ) go (yānti). 'mad-bhaktā yānti mām api'—My devotees (mad-bhaktāḥ) reach (yānti) Me (mām) also (api). This analysis focuses on the 'Theoretic Law of Attraction.' Krishna warns that the 'Destination' is determined by the 'Object of Worship.' In the 'Theoretic Framework of Cosmic Geography,' the planets of the demigods are still within the 'Material Universe' and are thus 'Antavat' (Finite). When the 'Punya' (merit) is exhausted, the soul must return. This detailed analysis reveals that Krishna defines 'Alpa-medhas' (Small intelligence) as the inability to distinguish between the 'Eternal' and the 'Ephemeral.' This shloka provides a ' Framework for Long-Term Spiritual Investment.' It teaches that 'The Quality of the Reward' matches 'The Quality of the Devotion.' Krishna is telling Arjuna that 'Why settle for a temporary lease in heaven when you can have an eternal home with Me?' This is the ' Goal of the Discerning Seeker,' where 'The Result' is 'Perpetual'.</p>
            [Image showing two paths: one leading to a cloud-city (demigod realm) that has a sunset (signifying ending), and another path leading to a radiant, eternal Sun (Krishna) that never sets]
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Antavat' (Finite/Perishable) is the 'Theoretic Description of Material Decay.' In our practical lives, even 'Winning the Lottery' is a 'Temporary Fruit.' Krishna is stating that any 'Boon' that ends with the 'Death of the Body' is a 'Poor Deal.' Krishna is defining 'The Self' as the 'One who seeks the Infinite.' This shloka provides a 'Framework for Strategic Wisdom.' It teaches that 'Wisdom' is the ability to look 'Beyond the Horizon.' Krishna is defining 'Mad-bhaktāḥ' (My devotees) as those who have 'Graduated' from material desire to spiritual love. This verse is the ' Proof that we become what we worship.' By using the word 'Api' (Also/Indeed), He emphasizes that reaching Him is the 'Natural and Final Conclusion.' This shloka is the 'Universal Manual for the Ambitious Soul,' forcing us to realize that 'It takes the same amount of effort to worship a candle as it does to worship the Sun—so why choose the candle?'. This is the ' Goal of the Eternal Seeker,' where 'The Destination' is 'Supreme'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 7.23 explores the  'Ontology of the Finite Reward.' , 'Time' is the 'Devourer' of all material fruits. This verse highlights the 'Theory of the Proportional Destination.' Philosophically, it addresses the 'Nature of Alpa-medhas' (Limited Intellect). , 'Intelligence' is not 'Cleverness' but the 'Sense of Value.' To trade the 'Eternal' for the 'Temporary' is the 'Theoretic Definition of Folly.' This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the Transcendental Return.'</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Yānti' (Go/Reach) refers to 'The Philosophy of Resonance.' , the soul 'Gravitates' toward the energy it has 'Cultivated' during its life. Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Nature of the Divine Residence.' , 'My Home' (*Mām*) is 'Beyond the Cycle of Time.' This shloka is the  'End of Secular Ambition.' , even 'Heaven' is a 'Golden Cage' if it is not 'Eternal.' Philosophically, it highlights the 'Relationship between the Mode of Worship and the Fate of the Worshipper.' , 'Devotion' is the 'Fuel' and 'Direction' is the 'Target.' Krishna is teaching 'Metaphysical Economics.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches 'The Urgency of Choosing the Highest.' This verse is the ' Proof that the Supreme Goal is the only logical choice,' providing the logical structure to understand that 'God is found at the end of the unmixed path'. It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the Imperishable'.</p>
