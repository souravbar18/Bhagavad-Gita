        बहिरन्तश्च भूतानामचरं चरमेव च।<br>

        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>The Supreme Truth exists outside and inside of all living beings, the moving and the nonmoving. Because He is subtle, He is beyond the power of the material senses to see or to know. Although far, far away, He is also near to all.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>In Shloka 13.16, Lord Krishna continues the ' Mapping' of the Absolute, using spatial and conceptual ' Paradoxes' to define its nature. He states that the Truth is 'bahir antaśh cha bhūtānām'—outside and inside all living beings. This analysis reveals the ' Totality' of the Divine. He is ' External' as the ' Universe' we observe, and ' Internal' as the ' Dweller' in the heart. Krishna describes the Lord as 'acharaṁ charam eva cha'—both non-moving and moving. This shloka provides a ' Framework' for understanding God as the ' Paradox' of stillness and action. He is the ' Unmoved Mover.' This detailed analysis focuses on the ' Subtlety' of the spirit: 'sūkṣhmatvāt tad avijñeyam.' Because He is ' Subtle,' He is ' Unknowable' through the ' Gross Instruments' of the material senses. A ' Physical Eye' cannot see the spirit any more than it can see ' Gravity.' This shloka provides the logical structure to understand that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the transcendence of physical perception.' Krishna then uses the ' Spacing' of the Divine: 'dūra-sthaṁ chāntike cha tat'—He is far away, yet He is near. This detailed analysis suggests that to the ' Ignorant,' God is millions of miles away, but to the ' Wise,' He is closer than one's own breath. In our practical religious lives, this verse teaches us that the ' Distance' to God is not ' Physical' but ' Psychological.' The 'Detailed Analysis' of 'Avijñeyam' indicates that the Lord is reached through ' Realization' rather than ' Calculation.' This shloka helps the seeker realize that the Divine is ' All-Encompassing.' It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the सूक्ष्मत्वात्तदविज्ञेयं,' offering the logical structure to comprehend that 'God is found in the intimacy of the soul.' By understanding this ' Pervasiveness,' the seeker moves from a ' Search' in the external world to a ' Recognition' of the Truth that is already ' Present' within and without. This shloka is the ' Bridge' between the ' Far' and the ' Near,' providing the logical structure to comprehend that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the बहिरन्तश्च भूतानाम्'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 13.16 explores the 'Ontology of Subtlety and Proximity.' This verse introduces the ' concept' of the *Atman* as the ultimate ' Smallest' and ' Largest.' , Brahman is ' All-Pervasive' like space, yet ' Intimate' like awareness. Philosophically, this addresses the 'Problem of Transcendence vs. Immanence.' If God is inside, is He limited? If He is outside, is He distant? The answer lies in the ' Subtlety' (*Sūkṣhmatvāt*). , the ' Finest' can contain the ' Largest.' The 'Deep Philosophical Significance' lies in the ' Definition' of *Avijñeyam*. , the ' Objectifying Mind' cannot know the ' Subjective Self.' This shloka provides a ' Refutation' of the idea that God is a ' Geographical Object.' It asserts that ' Nearness' is a ' Quality of Awareness.' This verse highlights the 'Theory of the Simultaneous Duality.' , the moving and non-moving are ' Reflections' of the one ' Still Truth.' Philosophically, the phrase 'dūra-sthaṁ' highlights the ' Majesty' of the Divine, while 'antike' highlights His ' Mercy.' This 'Deep Philosophical Analysis' provides the ' Foundation' for 'Dhyana Yoga.' This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the 'दूरस्थं चान्तिके च तत्.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the silence that pervades all sound.' It provides the logical structure to understand that 'God is found in the space between thoughts'. , the Lord is the ' Ether' of consciousness. This understanding is essential for 'Sadhana,' as it provides the ' Encouragement' that the goal is not ' Far Away' in some heaven, but ' Accessible' here and now. It provides the ' Clarity' to overcome the ' Illusion' of separation, leading the seeker to the ' Peace' of being ' Home' in the Divine. This shloka is the ' Compass' for the internal journey, providing the logical structure to comprehend that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the अचरं चरमेव च'.</p>
