        नाहं प्रकाश: सर्वस्य योगमायासमावृत: |<br>

    <div class="religious-content">
        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My internal potency, and therefore they do not know that I am unborn and infallible.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna identifies the 'Theoretic Barrier of Divine Invisibility.' He says, 'nāhaṁ prakāśhaḥ sarvasya'—not (na) I (aham) manifest (prakāśhaḥ) to everyone (sarvasya). 'yoga-māyā-samāvṛitaḥ'—veiled (samāvṛitaḥ) by My internal potency (yoga-māyā). 'mūḍho ’yaṁ nābhijānāti'—this (ayam) foolish world (mūḍhaḥ) does not (na) know (abhijānāti). 'loko mām ajam avyayam'—Me (mām) as unborn (ajam) and imperishable (avyayam). This analysis focuses on the 'Theoretic Nature of Yoga-maya.' Unlike 'Maha-maya' which keeps the world attracted to matter, 'Yoga-maya' is the curtain God draws around Himself to preserve the 'Leela' (divine play). In the 'Theoretic Framework of Selective Revelation,' Krishna explains that He is not an object that can be seen by the physical eyes of anyone. He is 'Hidden in Plain Sight.' This detailed analysis reveals that Krishna defines 'Spiritual Blindness' as the result of Divine veiling. This shloka provides a ' Framework for the Privacy of God.' It teaches that God is 'Sovereign' and chooses when to reveal His identity. Krishna is telling Arjuna that the 'General Public' sees Him only as a human prince because they lack the 'Eye of Devotion.' This is the ' Goal of the Veiled Seeker,' where 'The Truth' is 'Guarded'.</p>
            
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Yoga-māyā' (Internal Potency) is the 'Theoretic Description of the Divine Screen.' In our practical lives, we cannot see the 'Electric Current' but only the 'Bulb.' Krishna is stating that He is the 'Current' that stays hidden behind the 'Form.' Krishna is defining 'The Self' as the 'One who is intentionally obscured.' This shloka provides a 'Framework for the Test of Faith.' It teaches that 'Visibility' is not a prerequisite for 'Reality.' Krishna is defining 'Ajam' (Unborn) and 'Avyayam' (Infallible) as the secrets that the 'Yoga-māyā' protects. This verse is the ' Proof that God is not available for casual inspection.' By using the word 'Mūḍhaḥ' (Foolish), He identifies those who judge by appearances. This shloka is the 'Universal Manual for the Sincere Soul,' forcing us to realize that 'God is a secret that reveals itself only to those who have the key of love'. This is the ' Goal of the Discerning Seeker,' where 'The Veil' is 'Acknowledged'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 7.25 explores the  'Ontology of Divine Hiddenness.' , 'Revelation' is an act of 'Will.' This verse highlights the 'Theory of the Dual Maya.' Philosophically, it addresses the 'Nature of Yoga-māyā.' , while 'Māyā' binds the soul to the world, 'Yoga-māyā' connects the soul to God by creating the necessary 'Distance' for love to grow. This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the Sovereign Revelation.'</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Nāhaṁ prakāśhaḥ' (I am not manifest) refers to 'The Philosophy of Transcendental Privacy.' , if God were visible to all, 'Free Will' would vanish because the awe of His power would compel worship. Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Nature of the Divine Paradox.' , God is 'All-Pervading' yet 'Nowhere to be seen.' This shloka is the  'End of Material Empiricism.' , the 'Scientific Method' cannot find God because it cannot penetrate 'Yoga-māyā.' Philosophically, it highlights the 'Relationship between the Knower and the Known.' , only those who are 'Known by God' can 'Know God.' Krishna is teaching 'Metaphysical Exclusivity.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches 'The Value of Inner Vision.' This verse is the ' Proof that faith is more than sight,' providing the logical structure to understand that 'God is found behind the curtain of His own power'. It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the Secret'.</p>
