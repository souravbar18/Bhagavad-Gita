        <p>The foolish cannot understand how a living entity can quit his body, nor can they understand what kind of body he enjoys under the spell of the modes of nature. But one whose eyes are trained in knowledge can see all this.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>In this tenth verse of the fifteenth chapter, Shri Krishna highlights the difference between spiritual blindness and divine vision regarding the presence of the soul. He explains that the deluded (<span class="highlight">Vimūḍhāḥ</span>) are unable to perceive the soul when it departs the body (<i>Utkrāmantam</i>), when it dwells within the body (<i>Sthitam</i>), or when it experiences the objects of the senses under the influence of the modes of nature (<i>Bhuñjānam guṇānvitam</i>). However, those who possess the Eye of Knowledge (<i>Jñāna-cakṣuṣaḥ</i>) can clearly see this reality. This analysis reveals that the presence of the soul is a subtle truth that remains hidden from those who are entirely focused on material appearances. To the deluded, life is merely a biological process of birth, consumption, and death. They see the physical shell but fail to recognize the Enlivener inside. This spiritual cataract prevents them from understanding the true nature of their own existence, leading them to misidentify with the temporary body and its suffering.</p>

        <p>From a religious standpoint, this verse is a call to awaken the dormant spiritual faculties within us. Krishna suggests that the soul is always active, either as a witness or as an experiencer, but its presence is only revealed to those who have refined their consciousness. The Eye of Knowledge is not a physical organ but the purified intellect (<span class="highlight">Buddhi</span>) that has been trained through scripture and devotion. This analysis emphasizes that without this vision, a person is considered blind in the spiritual sense, regardless of their worldly education. For Arjuna, this teaching is vital because it helps him see beyond the physical forms of his relatives on the battlefield. It allows him to realize that the soul is the constant factor that moves through the changing states of the body. By cultivating this vision, a devotee stops being distracted by the costume of the material world and starts recognizing the Actor (the soul) within. This realization is the first step toward liberation, as it breaks the illusion of being a purely physical creature and aligns the individual with the eternal spiritual reality that transcends birth and death.</p>

        <h2>Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis</h2>
        <p>The philosophical significance of Shloka 10 rests on the Theory of Subject-Object Discrimination. , it posits that the soul is the ultimate subject, while the body and its functions are objects of perception. The deluded cannot see the soul because they try to see the Seer as if it were a Seen object. This is a fundamental Category Error in human cognition. In this religious theory, the soul is <span class="highlight">Dṛg-rūpa</span> (the form of the seer) and can never be an object of the physical senses. , the Eye of Knowledge represents the shift from objective observation to subjective realization. It is the ability to perform a Real-Time Decomposition of experience, separating the pure consciousness from the biological impulses of the <span class="highlight">Gunas</span>.</p>

        <p>The  concept of <i>Guṇānvitam</i> (associated with the modes) is essential here. It suggests that the soul, though pure, appears to act and enjoy because it is clothed in the qualities of Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. The wise can see the soul as distinct from these qualities, whereas the ignorant mistake the movement of the Gunas for the movement of the soul. Philosophically, this verse addresses the Visibility of the Invisible. The soul is visible to the intellect just as mathematical truths are visible to the mind, even though they have no physical form. The  goal of the Gita is to upgrade the human Perceptual Apparatus so that the underlying spiritual substrate of the universe becomes more apparent than the superficial material effects. This analysis leads to the conclusion that liberation is essentially a Corrected Vision. Once the seeker sees the soul residing and departing, they realize the immortality of the self. This represents the ultimate  achievement of <span class="highlight">Sāṅkhya</span> philosophy, where the distinction between Purusha (spirit) and Prakriti (matter) becomes a lived experience rather than just a philosophical concept.</p>
