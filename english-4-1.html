        <p>The Blessed Lord said: I instructed this imperishable science of yoga to the sun-god, Vivasvan, and Vivasvan instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Ikshvaku.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna begins Chapter 4 by establishing the 'Ancient Pedigree' of the Gita’s teachings. He says, 'imam vivasvate yogam proktavan aham avyayam'—I (aham) taught (proktavan) this (imam) imperishable (avyayam) yoga to the Sun-god (vivasvate). 'vivasvan manave praha'—Vivasvan told it to Manu. 'manur ikshvakave 'bravit'—Manu spoke it to Ikshvaku. This analysis focuses on the 'Tradition of Knowledge' (Parampara). Krishna is declaring that the message he is giving to Arjuna is not a new invention or a temporary philosophy; it is an eternal, 'Avyayam' (imperishable) truth that has existed since the dawn of time. By mentioning Vivasvan (the Sun), Krishna highlights that the knowledge was first given to the administrative heads of the universe. The Sun-god is the source of all light and energy in our solar system, and similarly, this Yoga is the source of all spiritual light. The succession flows from the cosmic level (Vivasvan) to the progenitor of humanity (Manu) and then to the first king of the solar dynasty (Ikshvaku). This sequence proves that the Gita is primarily meant for 'Rajarshis'—royal sages—who have the responsibility to protect and lead society based on spiritual principles.</p>
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Avyayam' (imperishable) is the ' Foundation of Eternal Truth.' In our practical lives, knowledge changes, science evolves, and social norms shift. However, Krishna is claiming that the 'Science of the Soul' is constant. It does not become obsolete. Krishna is defining the Gita not as a 'Book,' but as a 'Transcendental Technology' for the soul. This shloka provides a 'Framework for Historical Authenticity.' It teaches that spiritual authority is derived from a 'Chain of Succession.' Krishna is defining his role not just as a friend of Arjuna, but as the 'Primordial Teacher' who transcends time. This verse is the ' Bridge' between the external duty discussed in Chapter 3 and the divine knowledge of Chapter 4. By naming specific historical figures, Krishna grounds the abstract philosophy into the 'Chronology of the Cosmos.' This shloka is the 'Universal Validation of Tradition,' forcing us to realize that 'We are part of a lineage that spans eons'. This is the ' Goal of Connecting with the Source,' where 'Wisdom' is 'Ancestral Heritage'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 4.1 explores the  'Timelessness of Spiritual Science.' , 'Truth' is that which remains unchanged in past, present, and future. This verse highlights the 'Theory of Divine Origin.' Philosophically, it addresses the 'Nature of Vivasvan.' , the Sun represents the 'Eye of the World' and 'Clarity.' The fact that Yoga was first given to him suggests that 'Light' (Intelligence) is the first requirement for 'Yoga.' This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the Primordial Word.'</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Parampara' (succession) refers to the 'Integrity of Transmission.' , knowledge is like 'Water' flowing through a 'Pipe.' If the pipe is broken or contaminated, the water loses its purity. Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Nature of Avyayam' (the non-decaying). , even when the 'Forms' of the world decay, the 'Principles' of the soul remain. This shloka is the  'End of Speculative Philosophy.' , one does not 'Invent' the truth; one 'Inherits' it and then 'Realizes' it. Philosophically, it highlights the 'Relationship between Divinity and History.' , 'God' intervenes in time to set the 'Wheel of Dharma' in motion. Krishna is teaching 'Metaphysical Continuity.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches 'The Sanctity of the Guru-Shishya Relationship.' This verse is the ' Justification for Vedic Authority,' providing the logical structure to understand that 'The Gita' is the 'Breath of the Eternal'. It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Truth' is 'Older than the Stars'.</p>
