        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>The Supersoul is the original source of all senses, yet He is without senses. He is unattached, although He is the maintainer of all living beings. He transcends the modes of nature, and at the same time He is the master of all the modes of material nature.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>In Shloka 13.15, Lord Krishna presents the ' Grand Paradox' of the Divine nature. He describes the Supersoul as 'sarvendriya-guṇābhāsaṁ'—possessing the appearance of the qualities of all senses—yet 'sarvendriya-vivarjitam'—completely devoid of material senses. This analysis reveals the ' Distinction' between ' Absolute Senses' and ' Material Senses.' God does not need a ' Fleshy Ear' to hear or a ' Biological Eye' to see. His perception is ' Pure Awareness.' This shloka provides a ' Framework' for understanding God as the ' Source' of all functions. Every ' Faculty' we possess is a ' Reflection' of His original power. Krishna further describes the Lord as 'Asaktaṁ' (unattached) yet 'Sarva-bhṛit' (the maintainer of all). This detailed analysis focuses on the ' Sovereignty' of God. He supports the entire universe, yet He is not ' Entangled' by it. He is like the ' Air' that supports a bird's flight without being moved by the bird's will. Krishna then mentions that He is 'Nirguṇaṁ' (without material qualities) yet 'Guṇa-bhoktṛi' (the master/enjoyer of the qualities). This shloka provides the logical structure to understand that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the balance of transcendence and immanence.' In our practical religious lives, this verse teaches us that while God is ' Beyond' our material world, He is intimately involved in its ' Maintenance.' The 'Detailed Analysis' of 'Guṇa-bhoktṛi' indicates that while the modes of nature (*Gunas*) bind the individual soul, they serve the Supreme Lord. Krishna is the ' Master' of the energy that enslaves us. This shloka helps the seeker realize that God's ' Greatness' lies in His ability to be ' All' while remaining ' One.' It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the निर्गुणं गुणभोक्तृ च (nirguṇaṁ guṇa-bhoktṛ ca),' offering the logical structure to comprehend that 'God is found in the freedom from material conditions.' By understanding this ' Paradox,' the seeker moves from a ' Anthropomorphic View' of God to a ' Spiritual Vision,' where the Divine is seen as the ' Ground' of all existence who remains forever ' Pure' and ' Detached.'</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 13.15 explores the 'Ontology of Functional Transcendence.' This verse introduces the ' concept' of the *Upanishadic* Absolute. , Brahman is ' All-Capable' without ' Instrumental Dependency.' Philosophically, this addresses the 'Problem of Dependency.' If God has senses, is He dependent on them? The answer is no; His senses are ' Non-Different' from His essence. The 'Deep Philosophical Significance' lies in the ' Definition' of *Nirguna*. , *Nirguna* does not mean ' Empty' but ' Free' from material ' Limitations.' This shloka provides a ' Refutation' of the idea that God is a ' Passive Observer.' By calling Him 'Sarva-bhṛit' (Maintainer), Krishna confirms the ' Active Providence' of the Divine. This verse highlights the 'Theory of Transcendental Enjoyment.' , God ' Enjoys' the modes of nature as their master, not as their slave. Philosophically, the phrase 'sarvendriya-guṇābhāsaṁ' highlights the ' Epistemology' of the Divine. This 'Deep Philosophical Analysis' provides the ' Foundation' for understanding the Lord's *Lila* (Divine Play). This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the 'असक्तं सर्वभृच्चैव.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the ability to support without being bound.' It provides the logical structure to understand that 'God is found in the heart of the modes yet remains untouched'. , the Lord is the ' Master of the Puppet Strings' of nature. This understanding is essential for 'Vairagya,' as it provides the ' Archetype' for how a soul should live in the world—supporting its duties without ' Attachment.' It provides the ' Clarity' to overcome the ' Illusion' of being the 'Maintainer' of one's family or work, leading the seeker to the ' Peace' of surrendering that role to the true 'Sarva-bhṛit.' This shloka is the ' Key' to a God who is both ' Impersonal Substratum' and ' Personal Controller,' providing the logical structure to comprehend that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the सर्वेन्द्रियगुणाभासम्'.</p>
