        <p>By the mercy of Vyasa, I have heard these most confidential talks directly from the master of all mysticism, Krishna, who was speaking personally to Arjuna.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>In this verse, Sanjaya acknowledges the source of his divine vision and expresses his deep gratitude. He says that it is Vyasa-prasadat—by the grace of Sage Vyasa—that he was able to hear this guhyam aham param (most supreme secret). He emphasizes that he heard this yogam directly from Yogeshvarat Krishnat—Krishna, the Master of all Yoga—who was svayam (personally) speaking it. This verse is a beautiful tribute to the <strong>Guru-shishya parampara</strong> (teacher-disciple lineage) in Hinduism. The analysis reveals that even divine revelation requires a channel or a guru. Sanjaya is identifying that without the grace of Vyasa, he would have remained blind to this transcendental event. This verse serves as a lesson in humility; it proves that spiritual attainment is often a gift from a higher source. The term Yogeshvara is a specific name for Krishna, signifying that He is the origin and the ultimate goal of all yoga. Sanjaya's diagnosis proves that truth is most powerful when heard Sakshat (directly) from the Source. This shloka provides a standard for spiritual lineage. It encourages the individual to honor those who have preserved and passed on the sacred teachings. It reinforces the idea that the Gita is not a human invention but a direct revelation from the Supreme. By mentioning Krishna speaking svayam, Sanjaya highlights the authenticity and the directness of the message. This verse also justifies the inclusion of the Gita in the Mahabharata, as it was recorded by Vyasa and relayed by Sanjaya. Thus, the Gita teaches that the Divine wisdom is available to those who are connected to the right source. Therefore, receiving the truth through a legitimate lineage is considered a great blessing. This verse is a moment of profound gratitude, as Sanjaya realizes the magnitude of the gift he has received. In summary, Sanjaya's acknowledgment of Vyasa is a reminder that the path to God is often paved by the grace of enlightened masters who act as bridges between the human and the divine.</p>
