        यो यो यां यां तनुं भक्त: श्रद्धयार्चितुमिच्छति |<br>

        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>I am in everyone’s heart as the Supersoul. As soon as one desires to worship some demigod, I make his faith steady so that he can devote himself to that particular deity.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna identifies Himself as the 'Theoretic Anchor of All Faith.' He says, 'yo yo yāṁ yāṁ tanuṁ bhaktaḥ'—whoever (yo yo) which (yāṁ yāṁ) form/body (tanuṁ) a devotee (bhaktaḥ). 'śhraddhayārchitum ichchhati'—desires (ichchhati) to worship (architum) with faith (śhraddhayā). 'tasya tasyāchalāṁ śhraddhāṁ'—for each of them (tasya tasya) steady (achalāṁ) faith (śhraddhāṁ). 'tām eva vidadhāmy aham'—that (tām) indeed (eva) bestow (vidadhāmi) I (aham). This analysis focuses on the 'Theoretic Neutrality of the Divine Will.' Krishna reveals a profound secret: 'Faith' itself is a gift from the Supreme, even if that faith is directed elsewhere. In the 'Theoretic Framework of Divine Tolerance,' Krishna does not force everyone to worship Him directly. Instead, He acts as the 'Paramātma' (Supersoul) within the heart, 'Solidifying' the faith of the seeker in whichever direction they choose. This detailed analysis reveals that Krishna defines 'Grace' as the 'Maintenance of Consistency.' This shloka provides a ' Framework for Religious Freedom.' It teaches that 'The Energy' behind any worship comes from one source. Krishna is telling Arjuna that 'I am so compassionate that I even help those who ignore Me to be successful in their chosen path.' This is the ' Goal of the Supportive Seeker,' where 'The Foundation' is 'Fixed'.</p>
            [Image showing various rays of light (faith) emanating from a single central source (Krishna) and reaching different smaller lamps (demigods), illustrating how He powers all forms of worship]
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Achalāṁ śhraddhāṁ' (Unshakable Faith) is the 'Theoretic Description of the Psychological Glue.' In our practical lives, 'Faith' is what keeps a person going. Krishna is stating that He provides this 'Glue' to everyone, regardless of their 'Target.' Krishna is defining 'The Self' as the 'Enabler of Human Intent.' This shloka provides a 'Framework for Universal Respect.' It teaches that if someone has deep faith in a 'Form' (*Tanu*), that faith is divinely supported. Krishna is defining 'Vidadhāmi' (I bestow/arrange) as the 'Active Participation' of God in human devotion. This verse is the ' Proof that God is the battery behind every religious bulb.' By using the word 'Tanu' (Body/Form), He implies that any 'Finite Form' is just a container for His Infinite energy. This shloka is the 'Universal Manual for the Sincere Soul,' forcing us to realize that 'Even when we turn away from the Sun to look at a candle, it is the Sun's heat that allows the candle to burn'. This is the ' Goal of the Sustained Seeker,' where 'The Power' is 'Shared'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 7.21 explores the  'Ontology of the Faith-Mechanism.' , 'Faith' (*Shraddha*) is the 'Prerequisite' for any experience. This verse highlights the 'Theory of Divine Non-Interference.' Philosophically, it addresses the 'Nature of the Supersoul.' , God is 'The Witness' who 'Validates' the soul's choices without 'Coercing' them. This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the Empowering Presence.'</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Yo yo' (Whoever) refers to 'The Radical Inclusivity of the Divine.' , 'God' is the 'Foundation' of the 'Atheist's logic' and the 'Idol-worshipper's devotion' alike. Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Nature of the Divine Paradox.' , God 'Supports' the 'Mistake' of the soul to allow for 'Free Will.' This shloka is the  'End of Religious Pride.' , if 'My Faith' is a 'Gift from Him,' I cannot boast about it. Philosophically, it highlights the 'Relationship between the Source and the Secondary.' , the 'Secondary' (Demigod) is just a 'Point of Focus' provided by the 'Source.' Krishna is teaching 'Metaphysical Generosity.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches 'The Sanctity of Every Heart's Desire.' This verse is the ' Proof that no sincere seeker is lost,' providing the logical structure to understand that 'God is found in the very ability to believe'. It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Spirit' is 'Found in the Trust'.</p>
