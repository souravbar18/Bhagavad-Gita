        रागद्वेषवियुक्तैस्तु विषयानिन्द्रियैश्चरन् ।<br>

        <p>But a person free from all attachment and aversion and able to control his senses through regulative principles of freedom can obtain the complete mercy of the Lord.</p>
        
        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna offers a radical solution to the problem of sensory agitation. He says that one who moves among the 'Vishayan' (sense objects) with 'Indriyai' (senses) that are 'Raga-Dvesha-Viyuktaih' (free from attachment and aversion) and 'Atma-Vashyaih' (controlled by the self) attains 'Prasadam' (inner tranquility or grace). This analysis focuses on the concept of 'Regulated Freedom.' Krishna is not telling Arjuna to run away from the world or to blind his eyes. He is suggesting a 'Neutral Interaction.' In our practical lives, we are usually 'Pushed' by what we like (*Raga*) and 'Pulled' by what we hate (*Dvesha*). We are like puppets on these two strings. Krishna suggests cutting these strings. When you are free from these two biases, you can 'Caran' (walk/move) in the world without being contaminated by it. This is the 'State of the Vidheyatma'—one whose heart and mind are under his own command.</p>
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Prasadam' (tranquility) is essential. It is not just peace; it is a 'Divine Lucidity.' Usually, we think that to get peace, we must get what we like. Krishna says peace comes when you 'Stop Liking and Disliking' in a compulsive way. Imagine a scientist looking at a data set; he doesn't love the high numbers or hate the low ones; he simply observes. This 'Objective Observation' is what Krishna wants Arjuna to apply to the battlefield. By having senses that are 'Atma-Vashyaih' (self-controlled), Arjuna can perform his duty as a warrior without being clouded by the 'Sneha' (sticky attachment) for his kin or the 'Dvesha' (hatred) for the enemy. This shloka provides a 'Framework for Living in the World.' It teaches that 'Liberation' is not the 'Absence of Objects' but the 'Absence of Reaction.' This verse is the ' Foundation of Emotional Neutrality,' proving that 'Power' is the ability to 'Interact' without 'Reacting.' By attaining 'Prasadam,' the mind becomes like a 'Clear Mirror.' This shloka is the 'Universal Antidote to the Ladder of Fall,' forcing us to realize that we can remain 'Pure' even in the 'Marketplace' if our 'Inner Compass' is not swayed by 'Preferences'. This is the ' Goal of Mental Sovereignty,' where the 'Self' is the 'Ruler' of its own 'Sensory Experience'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 2.64 explores the  'Symmetry of Interaction.' , 'Raga' and 'Dvesha' are the 'Vitiating Factors' of 'Prakriti.' They create 'Dualistic Distortion.' This verse highlights the 'Theory of Neutral Sensory Engagement.' Philosophically, it addresses the 'Nature of Vashya' (mastery). , 'Mastery' is not the 'Cessation of Action' but the 'Purification of Motive.' This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the Self-Regulated Being' (*Vidheyatma*).</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Atma-Vashyaih' refers to the 'Hierarchy of Consciousness.' , the 'Atman' (Self) should govern the 'Buddhi,' which governs the 'Manas,' which governs the 'Indriyas.' When this 'Chain of Command' is established, one attains 'Prasada.' Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Nature of Grace' (*Prasadam*). , 'Grace' is the 'Natural State' of the soul when it is no longer 'Agitated' by 'Aversion' or 'Attachment.' This shloka is the  'End of Hedonism and Nihilism.' , the 'Hedonist' is a slave to 'Raga,' and the 'Cynic' is a slave to 'Dvesha.' The 'Yogi' is 'Viyukta' (free from both). Philosophically, it highlights the 'Relationship between Discipline and Serenity.' , 'Discipline' is the 'Vessel' and 'Serenity' is the 'Liquid.' Krishna is teaching 'Functional Transcendence.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches 'Purity of Soul.' This verse is the ' Definition of Spiritual Health,' providing the logical structure to understand that 'Health' is 'Wholeness'—a state where the 'Self' is 'One' and 'Undivided' by external 'Likes' and 'Dislikes'. It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'True Peace' is the 'Fragrance' of 'Self-Control'.</p>
