        <p class="section-title">Summary Translation:</p>
        <p>Knowing this, the ancient seekers of liberation performed their duties. Therefore, you should also perform your duty, following in the footsteps of your ancestors.</p>

        <div class="point-box">
            <span class="box-subtitle">Detailed Analysis:</span>
            <p>Krishna provides the 'Historical Precedent' for Arjuna. He says, 'evam jnatva kritam karma'—knowing (jnatva) thus (evam) work (karma) was performed (kritam). 'purvair api mumukshubhih'—by the ancients (purvaih) even (api) who were seekers of liberation (mumukshubhih). 'kuru karmaiva tasmat tvam'—therefore (tasmat) you (tvam) perform (kuru) work (karma) indeed (eva). 'purvaih purvataram kritam'—as performed (kritam) by the ancients (purvaih) in ancient times (purvataram). This analysis focuses on the 'Traditional Validation of Action.' Arjuna had a misconception that Action is the opposite of Liberation. He believed that to be free, one must stop acting. Krishna corrects this by pointing to the 'Mumukshus' (seekers of Moksha) of the past, like Janaka. These great souls did not retire to the forest to find God; they remained in the world, performed their heavy duties as kings and warriors, but did so with the 'Knowledge' (*Jnatva*) mentioned in the previous verse—the knowledge that the soul is not the doer and has no desire for fruits. Krishna uses 'Purvataram' to emphasize that this is a 'Perennial Philosophy.' It is not a new invention for Arjuna; it is the 'Tried and Tested Path' of the sages. By telling Arjuna 'Kuru Karma' (Do your work), He is commanding him to accept his social responsibility (*Dharma*) but with a transformed consciousness. </p>
            <p>The detailed analysis of 'Mumukshu' is the ' Description of a Dynamic Seeker.' In our practical lives, we often think spirituality means 'Inactivity.' Krishna is stating that 'High-Level Duty' can be the 'Highest-Level Yoga.' Krishna is defining 'Tradition' not as a 'Blind Ritual' but as a 'Living Example' of success. This shloka provides a 'Framework for Lineage-based Learning.' It teaches that we should look at the 'Lives of the Great' (*Mahajano yena gatah sa panthah*). Krishna is defining 'Action' as a 'Sacrifice.' This verse is the ' Bridge' between 'Ancient Wisdom' and 'Current Crisis.' By using the word 'Purvaih,' He connects Arjuna to a long line of noble heroes, making him feel part of a 'Divine Mission.' This shloka is the 'Universal Call to Conscious Participation,' forcing us to realize that 'We don't need to quit life to find Truth'. This is the ' Goal of Modernizing Ancient Duty,' where 'The Past' guides 'The Present'.</p>

            <span class="box-subtitle">Deep Philosophical Significance and  Analysis:</span>
            <p>Philosophically, Shloka 4.15 explores the  'Consistency of the Path.' , the 'Laws of Spirit' do not change with 'Time.' This verse highlights the 'Theory of Exemplary Conduct.' Philosophically, it addresses the 'Nature of Mumukshutva' (Desire for Liberation). , 'Liberation' is not a 'Location' you reach by leaving work; it is a 'State of Mind' you attain by 'Perfecting' work. This verse highlights the 'Ontology of the Working Sage.'</p>
            <p>The  framework of 'Kuru Karma' (Do Action) refers to the 'Mandate of Existence.' , as long as one has a body, total inaction is impossible. Therefore, the only choice is to 'Act with Wisdom.' Philosophically, this verse addresses the 'Nature of Tradition' (*Parampara*). , tradition is the 'Collected Experience' of those who already solved the 'Paradox of Action.' This shloka is the  'End of Spiritual Individualism.' , we are not 'Inventing' the path; we are 'Walking' it. Philosophically, it highlights the 'Relationship between Knowledge and Practice.' , 'Jnatva' (Knowing) must precede 'Kritam' (Doing). If one acts without knowing the 'Divyam' nature of the soul, they stay bound. Krishna is teaching 'Metaphysical Heritage.' From a religious perspective, this shloka teaches 'The Authority of the Rishis.' This verse is the ' Foundation for the Householder's Yoga,' providing the logical structure to understand that 'Worldly life is the Laboratory of the Spirit'. It highlights the 'Sanatana' wisdom that 'The Path' is 'Everlasting'.</p>
